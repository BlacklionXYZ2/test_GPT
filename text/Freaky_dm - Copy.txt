Sexist fr
Oh yeah

Skirts
Scotsmen
Thigh high socks
Scotsmen
Kilts not skirts

Different things
Still
Very different
Guys being gay and crossdressing is different
Fun fact, skirt and shirt used to be the same piece of clothing
Indeed
Not really
You saw thor
How many gay crossdressers have you seen?
Many
not seen any cross dressers tbf
Cus they blend in fr
Thailand fr <This message was edited>
@Stan I will pay you £100 to wear high heels to the next dnd session
Bro i’ll do it for free /J
Easy loss of 100 squid there
dude holy shit what a deal
You have to wear them the whole time
Ong
Easy bro
that’s an insanely good deal
£100 quid to do something i was gonna do anyway?
If you take them off one £100 is off <This message was edited>
Sign me up
okay sista 💅💅
This is just burning money at this point
Why would i get my grippers out at a dnd session anyway?
This message was deleted.
I will give a extra £10 for any other female clothing
I need the £100 for a new set of heels anyway
WE SAW THAT
Nuh uh
You about to lose every pound you have to your name
I will show up as a woman
I will get a wolf cut
Surgery and all
Will he pay me for that too tho?
At this rate yeah
Starting to think leo just likes traps
WHAT?
No I specified clothing
Damn
How much money do you have?
damn right
By the next session ~£400 in savings
I’m taking it all
Does piercings count?
The thighigh socks bout to go crazy
No that’s not clothing
You wear it dont you
You wear a piercing <This message was edited>
A piercings?
Oxford dictionary defines it as 
items worn to cover the body
And?
You've gone uncharacteristically quiet, toes? @ceylan
I will wear not a single item of masculine clothing
Watch me fr
Bet
I have to pay for motorcycle jackets
I need this money
Also why does leo pay me to be a femboy
Why not anyone else fr
I’m the only person stupid enough to do it
I’m a dumbass with to much money
As in why do you pay *me* <This message was edited>
For his age
Not why do *you* pay me
Cuz it’s funny to watch a military guy try to look like a woman
Yall never even seen me in a uniform
The only thing that makes me military is my attitude
Also bros jamming rn to chappel roan
Every time I’ve seen you you’re wearing some sort of camo
piercings aren’t gender specific
But you haven’t
Not when i wore the crop top
Not for a long time
I haven’t worn my cammies for months
How many straight men have you seen with piercings
Damn that's crazy
Our DM?
Jack Phillip warner?
1 is he straight 2 he looks good with them and only has a few
His bird?
we don’t know if he’s straight
bisexual people ?
Could be bi
Mmmm consider he called her a she
WEVE SEEN HIS GIRLFRIEND
I think bro is straight
queer men can have gfs guys let’s use our brains…
And yet
He isn’t queer
Hes stated this before
And yet no mention of a bf ever <This message was edited>
bc he has a gf???
😭😭
And?
if i was to get a bf would that make me suddenly straught guys?
He's had more than one partner
Yeah for the time
But hes said hes straight
It doesn’t get much more convincing than that
not sure it works like that guys
a bisexual person can date the same or opposite gender and REMAIN bisexual
it doesn’t just turn on and off..cmon guys
Jus saying
we’re discussing the principle 💯
Is jack straight
Has he said hea straight
Then he’s straight
the principle 🗣️
Of what?
of this🗣️
You are right@ceylan bisexuality is kinda permanent
that’s what i’m saying
My mate chloe is bi, but is dating a man
ya and she’s STILL bi
@ stan
That's... what i said?
i know i’m just reminding certain someonebodies 🤨🤨
But are you gay if you date someone of the opposite gender?
You can identify as gay
No denying that
But is what you’re doing gay?
True
what kind of gay we talking
like homosexual or bisexual
It's just gay mate
umbrella term type shit 🥀🥀
I never said a bi person dating someone of the opposite gender was gay
what
That's just bi
Specifically homosexual
ts is what i’m referring to
you don’t just
switch back to being straight
don’t work like that
No what your doing is straight tho
it’s a heterosexual relationship ya but that doesn’t make the person heterosexual
You can be whatever you want
So you can suddenly be straight
get this on a shirt asap💯💯
Truth
I will
Self expression is important fr
Can we like just quit this argument
not an argument buddy
Kinda is
Lets just agree that anyone can be anything and it doesn’t matter to anyone else what you are fr
Wtf 🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭
Ong
what’s up🥺🥺
It's weird 🥺🥺🥺🥺
what’s weird 🥺🥺
That fucking photo 🥺🥺🥺
Crazy photo ngl 🥺🥺🥺🥺

plush
it’s a biddhait
buddhist
thing
Is it?

I think it might be Jewish?
That's Muslim
I think
Funfact
You can have French surgically removed from your body
How's the walking home going @ceylan ?

lowkey had to tell several girls tonight that their bfs got way too flirty with other girls
including me
which is insane
bc how do guys like that exist
when they have such awesome gfs
I dunno
insane bs
Being drunk does that?
clearly
2 guys man
like kys…
Also shows that the relationship wasn't that great to begin
Ey?
Wdym bro?
Take the girlfriends if the boys can’t be bothered to care for them
Like ong, if you are drunk and your drunk instinct is to flirt, get a life check?
fr man
told all their gfs
Well exes now we hope
we pray
Ong
on a real jote
Ooh yes?
why do people stay in relationships if they’re not happy
doesn’t make sense to me
isn’t the point of relationships ti find happiness and acceptance in another and if you can’t find that then what’s the point
Because sometimes it's like romeo, where what's important os the fact your in a relationship not that your with that person
Status and shit
not the gcse reference pls
i didn’t do remote
demoed
renown
HELP
Get to be "better" than others
You good there?
not especially
Dym romeo and Julie?
Juliet*
Anyhow yeah

A mate of mine had to put up with something like that
Twas horrible
jeez

i ain’t got no lemons on god
Damn, go buy one?
Like tf?
blud thinks i’m gonna leave the house the day after drinking  😭😭
Why not

tired
the joys of alcohol 🎉
Damn that's crazy
Excuses excuses
You’ve slept enough
sure sure
anwyays gang what are we doing for our characters
gonna build mine at some point today or tomorrow
Me and stan have both done fighters I think?
Stan is tanking. I'm just doing dive
So that's us
Dunno bout the others
so what do you reckon i should do
a spellcaster perhaps?
@Oscar Hunt Brown yo how many spellcasters we got already?
Maybe a healer?
jack said no healer if we actually wanna join in i think
Or a dps with some more mobility
what does this mean 🙏
A damage focused character who can move between enemies faster than the usual meat wall we seem to have
Dps is world of warcraft jargon that applies to alot of things
Bro you play ow right?
Well its just called damage in overwatch isnt it?
Not unless they’ve changed it
But dps is just damage per second
It’s an abbreviation of itself
Yep
Its use in a class comp hails from early MMORPGs
Thank you you fucking nerd
Anyhow @ceylan you can make healers, only if you actually intend to heal
He says in a dnd chat
That's what Jack said
Oh sorry neek
Truth is we have no clue what the team needs because we haven’t been told the complete composition yet
Nope
Quit being a dick, i was simply sharing a fact
@Oscar Hunt Brown
I too am stating a fact
You are a neek
Neek= nerd+geek
Will, you’re not mike B stop tryna be him fr
I'm just being logical
Is that a crime?
Thats his excuse to be a misogynist
Am I being misogynistic
No
I am calling you what you ate
Are*
You are however being a dick for no real reason
Am I?
You called me a “fucking nerd” and by extension “fucking neek” to be nice?
Fair play
Apologies
And with that
I vanish
okay solid
What a roller coaster
And to add to it, I’m currently ordering my first car
Sick
Wicked
Drift tires??
Nah, going for a Seat Arona <This message was edited>

He a bitch frfr
That’s cuz I find it funny
Mhmm
💖 My gender identity is none of your concern girlie 💖
Stan with respect I will never and have never found you attractive
You missed a couple double negatives there
You could have said that disrespectfully and my opinion wouldn’t change a bit
And a couple commas
Although on that note
I’m getting my £100 one way or another.
Also this is the freaky dm for a reason
I mean it’s in the name

Worth it
But if i do it?

Food
Food is.pretty good ngl

(i had noodles 15 minutes ago)
Dayum
No nutrition for anyone
Stan you had a sunshine burger stfu
And?
protein 💯
Its hardly a balanced diet
Its all meat
Last i checked noodles had no protein
I could have Mac and cheese, I could have a wrap, I could have essentially small sandwiches, or like just a fuckton of chocolate
Mix all 4
No
wrap
Drywall is pretty good ngl
the burga

Who wants to have a perfectly normal conversation
I want you to know I’m trying to be nice
You’re not helping
POLL:
Are women attractive
OPTION: Yes (5 votes)
OPTION: Or yes (2 votes)
gang what!
It's a simple question
Yes
Or yes
this FEELS icky somehow
How?
It is not derogatory or lewd
But a simple remark
You’re lacking on inclusivity
fuck it
There are gay men here
?
I thought leo was bi?
Sorry if i genuinely forgor there
No thats jack and Oscar
Ahh thank you stanley
I am heterosexual
Apologies present gay people

Jack is fully bisexual however
Fair enough

We're not that degenerative
Pesbian lorn though
NO
Not this again
Its simple mathematics/J
Wdym again?
That sounded guttural there
<>
i have a real passionate hatred toward the sexualisation of lesbians
Lesbian porn is superior for a heterosexual since it contains twice as many woman and no men
Thats fair
But not there male counterparts?
what
sexualisation of gay people is bad full stop innit
To clarify this is meant for crude comedy, not my actual belief
but lesbians seem to face the larger of the challenge
I think the correct answer is sexualisation is wrong in general mate
Sexualisation of anyone against their will is wrong <This message was edited>
i think both answers are right 🥺
It's a Venn diagram not a binary answer
I’m finding it difficult to take this conversation seriously while blasting german rock music
It may be wrong, but it can also be funny as shit at times
No?
Real
Dakota in with his wild card answer
As per usual
The devil needs an advocate
Is bro listening to sturmann rn?

WHAT IS UP WITH OW THIS WEEK, PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY LEAVING AFTER A SINGLE TEAMFIGHT
ow is buns
It literally is rn bro wtf
These are not plat lobbies
Sounds like average wannabe pro players imo
See them all the time in darktide
Yeah but they weren't here last week
They kinda just appeared  or sumn
@Dakota i hath made a detritus
Have you made you corporal carrot
I have
Wonderful
Oh wait I forgot to do magic items and stuff
@Stan do you want to make a vimes for us?
Yeah that helps
I brought the crossbow as well
Are you making detritus
Yes
And dakota is carrot
I shall make vimes
YEEEAAAAHH
This is gonnabe brill
I think we all did paladin
Wait who else can we include
Greebo
Who else is coming?
And doesn't already have a character?
Nah nobby nobs mate
We just get Stan in his cadet uni
Variant human, rogue for nobs obviously
Would Sybil be beastmaster ranger or drakewarden ranger
Drakewarden I believe
Did you do paladin for carrot btw?
Nah full fighter
Got it
Battlemaster
That's sound actually
Full paladin for detritus
9 manoeuvres is just too many tho
No it isn't bro
You will burn through those so fast
Really?
Yes bro
What maneuvers did you take?
Ranger for vimes since he knows most about his city?
Yeah maybe?
I did paladin cuz of the oath of watchers
Lunging attack, parry, riposte, brace, precision attack, menacing attack, sweeping attack, disarming attack and rally
How.many die you got?
Don’t forget the watchman background
Hwere is that?
Couldn't find it
6d12
Investigator
Yeah ypu will get through those real fast
Oh ok then
I took knight of the order
What’s the feature of that? <This message was edited>
Don't matter just swapped already
Right now I have to memorise detritus quotes
Detritus fetch the search warrant
Aye aye commander
I literally have the great club and heavy crossbow
In still bringing the spirit board for the funny stan
Ask Ben or Jack if you can make an actual full peicemaker, pretty sure they’d be on board
Nevermind you’ve got it covered
Nah i wouldn't use it all that much tbh
It's for the funny more than anything
Loving how features and traits can now be filtered by class, species, and feats
Sick tbh
Oh dear Om
What?
With a single piece of armour, I have ac 24 <This message was edited>
Damn mines 19
Whats bros health tho?
220
214
Dayum
But i have the goliath traits
And sheild master
Yeah part of this is the tough feat
Same
Would you need the tough feat tho?
No but battlemaster gives tonnes of feats so I was just looking for any to use them on
I even ran out and had to take an actual score improvement
Damn
But my intelligence is shit all
You telling me
Nah that’s fair
Apart from that and my charisma, my stats are kinda broken
I rolled 13 on strength, it’s currently 17
Haha
Cute
I have yet to do magic items for it
I might do inquisitive rogue
Cus vimes started life in a gang
And has quite the investigation skill toward people
I can’t work out if carrot would suit the sword of thrones command better or a crystal sword bc shiny
Thrones command obviously
But the crystal does a flat d8 extra on any hit compared to a +1
Thematic over power hear mate
True true
Plus his royal sword is notably inert in terms of magic
Its a defining trait
oh…
ts shit hurts bro💔
I knew you’d catch on eventually
@ceylan are you thinking miku
What
What is bro on about
@Leo you gotta start thinking *BEE* my friend
Stfu
Die
Perish
Kys <This message was edited>
Do not mention that film around here
Ya like jazz
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
How should I start it? "You like jazz?"
My clipboard wouldn't allow me to copy the whole thing
Believe me
I tried

Dude you’re 20 mins late, broseph is in the land of sweet dreams rn <This message was edited>
Not my fault I was being briefed for the parade this weekend
He can see it in the morning
Damn
Briefings
The bane of the gung ho cadet
It’s not like I listen, it’s the same armed forces as it is every year
Yep
Its the same thing every year
But somehow the briefing gets longer
They have actually changed something this year, they decided to plan for the heat
But I think they went a little over the top
We’re allowed to do 15 mins work for 45 mins rest
Jesus
Was the enforced drinking not enough?
Or the cooldown PT?
The cadet forces have fallen
Millions must be hazed
We didn’t get no cooldown pt, we just get released like feral animals
Damn we had to do a PT run
Now that i think about it i think the staff was just a masochist
Ha
But
Atleast we did something
We get to watch each other faint and have to be told not to just step out the way
Damn you don’t catch em?
Only when ordered
We’ve always had atleast one cadet collapse
Just like
Catch him
We just have repeat offenders
Yeah its usually the same guy
It’s also great when we have more than a single member of staff from our squad
Honestly these big events always get overplanned
And in spite of that they still don’t go to plan
There’s a plan?
Sometimes
And that’s just when it’s a single branch, multi force just gets worse
Don’t forget the post op scraps
Can’t let them air casets walk off without a good ass whoopin
Bet I usually got my spikes in my pockets
Ik a kid who read your entire basic training syllabus so he could quote it incorrectly
Army cadets are the pettiest shits i have ever met
Anyway goodnight all
Night
MANN IM PLAYING APEX AND MY TEAMMATE IS LITERALLY DOUNG HIS FUCKING DAILY DUOLINGO LESSON
Then stop playing one of the worst shooters ever
Bro how about you stop being such a fucking redditer
*redditor
Hop on splitgate 2 instead
NERD
Bro how about you just let people play the games they enjoy
Like tf?
Nah
I’m just intentionally being an asshole
Cus i find it funny
Not you
Your just a cunt
AND I expect that
*you’re
Ik its bait
I’m doing it anyway
And congratulate it
Now go
Cyberbully a cripple /J

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
How should I start it? "You like jazz?"
Damn he just roll up like that
Ya like jazz?
Gotta start thinking bee my friend

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.

How should I start it? "You like jazz?"
Nah bandits decent
Bandit tricking a thatcher is the funniest shit
He crashes tf out
Thatcher needs a buff tbf
Idk if you pair him with iq he can be pretty strong
Electric scanner go brrrrrrr
Running smoke on blitz is great cus the last thing they ever see is grey then a big german man evaporating their retinas
I’ve played blitz about twice, the flashes hardly ever work
Nah you gotta get close
Now if they did damage… different story
Within 4 meters and they’re powerless to stop you
Just play clash you scum
But they ruined her now so stfu
You don’t even need to hold the shield any more
Just leave it somewhere and go piss of someone else
All it does is slow them now
Hate the new electrics
My bad you can’t disintegrate a whole human with like 2 shocks <This message was edited>
Such sad news
I just had the most bottom 500 plays tonight
Shot an australian in the back of the head cus bro was too busy window peaking
Quiet bug chicken
_they said it couldn’t be done_
Why tf he got cum stains over his ass
_they said it was designed for tanks_
I was tryna ignore that
Anyone wanna hop on siege?
Nvm just went 3 0 im
A go eep
Damn that’s sad
Can’t end on a loss
Will where tf are you getting these
Do not utter those foul words to me mortal
This is unhealthy
Handmade
Moreso than my new onset siege addiction
This is the wonders of the Google search engine my guy
Crazy what you can find
Most of its ass ngl
Crazy what you shouldn’t
Aw do you not like free speech
That's right
Bitch
No
I do
But some people clearly don’t deserve it
But not when the free speech gives instant trauma
👆 wise man
You son of a bitch
Those are my memea
Memes*
Stfu
Shortass
Slight spelling error
Opinion invalid
A taste of your own medicine
We share a mother
Tad bit rude innit
I can hear you cackling through the walls
Stfu
Hehehhehe
Are we actually gonna sleep or can i yap about siege again
Yap tf away
I’m just gonna say it
Montagne is kinda outdone by literally every other shield op
Ultimate protection tho
At the cost of doing fuck all
Bro sits in the corner “waiting to strike”
Plus you can just melee him and he fucking dies
Blitz can flash you
And blackbeard has a rifle
But Blackbeard’s ads time is shit
Fuze is arguably worse but he isn’t a dedicated shield op
I always get immediately headshot
He can dive through windows without dropping his shield tho
Fuze shouldn’t be in a place where he needs a shield
True
Yeah the cluster is better used through walls
He shouldn’t be rushing like any other shield should
Anyway goodnight all - tmr we aim for copper 2
Take a ram, and get over site and the game should be yours except for the singular roamed
Frrr
If you have any other intel operator like iq or lion it gets even easier
You can force the other team to move when they don’t want to
Who’s better for intel, lion or dok?
Hmm
It’s gotta be dok
But if you have iq she can see the others when they try and hang up
Easy wall bang potential
Alright who for pings, cav or jackal?
Cav is better for team play
Jackal can get roamers pretty easy
What about thermite or ace?
Who breaches better?
I say ace, bc you can shoot the second canister to make it head hole only, instead of getting jumped out on
Fairs
Imma eep mow
Now
Gotta get ready for tmrs games
Stay up, why rest when the games still on
Shhh
I’m making good decisions for once
Nah that’s what adulthood is for
I’m gonna sleep for like ~5 hours
Then right back to it
Or
Go for 5 hours, then sleep
Shhhh
Let me have this
I’m already in bed
Can you not play from bed?
I’m not getting my laptop to play siege 😭
Ha loser imagine not having console in your room

WHO TF IS DARIUS
Darius is coming for you
Yeah Darius is coming for you
And now he’s coming for us all
That was the most tame one I have
do you guys have irl copies of the like normal dnd book
lke the one one jack showed us all to read thru the other week
Just the dm book sadly
not the same one?
Uhhh no
I think
dang it
i want to do a dragon born
what would make sense for their class to be?
like i don’t want to make something silly u get me
Uhh anything really, but I'd avoid quote unquote, typically unintelligent classes
Like barbarian,
right okay
so they’re smart?
@Stan / @Jack Payne  take over for me wouldya
Id recommend something with nature, so Druid or ranger, or possibly a religious type, so mainly paladin
So it really depends on what type of Dragonborn you go for 
Because some classes benefit more from the resistance you get
okay i feel in my soul i may have to research this more
i’ll figure my shit out perhaps tomorrow i was just brainstorming
Bane of your existence
fr
I’m assuming your using 2014 rules Dragonborn since they’re arguably better
yur
Also I have no idea what will was going on about with avoiding the less intelligent classes 
They get a 2 star boost to strength and a plus to charisma
Gem Dragonborn make unhinged barbarians
Welp fuck me then
what classes benefit from  charisma?
and aren’t
street
The breath weapon really lends itself to a melee type person
strength
Sorcerer, rogue to a point, and warlock
Warlock 
Sorceror
Bard
Cleric (I think)
All charisma casters
thank you
Warlock and bard are the major charismas
Cleric is wisdom
Guys who wants to hop on?
What the big ow
out of the charisma classes who’s the easiest to understand basiclalt
Probs warlock?
Imo
Bard, but warlock is almost as easy if you can handle the spells
alrighty
Emerald dragon born bear totem barbarian
Would recommend
That would be 2 barbarian tho
no idea what this means but i’ll have a look tomorrow
Fair
Basically
Read the dragon colour table
And pick a cool one
Go from there
yar
Decide class after colour
Not before
okok
Look at it 
Both the gem Dragonborn subspecies
And the totem barbarian subclass 
Bear variant
We won't have subclasses so dw
We only second level
i’d probs pick silver or white tbf
Cool
Dik what they do
Idk
cold
thanks for the help gang i may require more come tomorrow
Anyway, hopping on… who’s up
I’m always up but will said he ain’t feeling it
For white dragons, I'd recommend doing ranger actually
Or unironically barbarian
is that like how n arrow type shit
Bow
Just from how white dragons are described
robin hood type shit
okok
Kinda
More just lethal hunters
Also statistically the worst class
But its 2nd level so dw
But it mostly focuses on survival and tracking
what makes you think i care abt meta cmon..
If you’re into knowing your environment that’s the class
alrigjty
thanks
If your doing silver I'd recommend cleric
Just cuz there apparently sociable and good willed
Just a suggestion
yar yar
i’ll have a gander in the morning x
Sick
although i kinda wanted to make a character who’s lowkey an opp so idk
White it is then
White dragons are motherfuckers
hell yeah
good
Literally described as primal and vengeful according to the monster manual
Fucking opps fr fr
They hate everyone except the white dragons huzz
Racists?
omfg hell yeah i could have this characters only arc be to find the huzx and the huzz  is called life weave
r
genius idea
No pleaseee
Except white dragons only stick around to smash and dash
This is meant to be a semi serious campaign
Sooo no
fine play🙄
okay*

YAYYY
wp
Ooh
Idk since that campaign doesn’t have the sources anymore

Where were you thinking of doing it?
Probably my place
I’ll need a lift there and back then

ashby road or smth
Wait maybe not actually, busses exist midweek
Drinking?

Amazing news, the right bus passes through the stop literally outside my house
The 15?

On the way to ibby right?
Not to ravo
It goes both ways
how’s through ravenstone

i take that shit to w*rk
Uhh no it doesn't?
does it not ?
i may be tripping
It goes Ravenstone then Coalville and then ellistown through to ibstock
cmon that’s what i said with extra steps
Yeah but a whole extra 40 minutes
okay that’s insane
quicker to walk it at that point
Its not
I did that once
Hour half to get there
damn
jesus
The bus literally says it takes 21 mins
Chat we can car pool if necessary
Yeah
Pretty sure Ceylan’s the only one that can drive in the group
Yuh

carpooling she will be okay with if she’s off work

Attendance
OPTION: Will be there (4 votes)
OPTION: Will not (0 votes)
If it’s happening not at the weekend I can
For the most part may need to check with parents
It is Wednesday next week
@Jack Payne @Oscar Hunt Brown
So looking at it 
That means we have James’ thing on the Tuesday then cyberpunk at yours day after
Its dnd
Please tell me I’ve got dates right here
You do yes
Oh k
I have major cyberpunk writers block rn
Wait you doing a dnd
Trying sm new
Yep
Eberron source specifically
I’ll put out character creation details in a bit
So I need to make a character for that then
Yep😊
i wanna learn how to dm sooo bad bc im so filled with stories and inspo and characters but zero knowledge of actually how to run
I’ve also spent the last 3 days working on my own thing as well
Its a good idea to watch some others dm and get ideas of how thats done
And YouTube
Everyone is trying dming
Its the natural next step
ya ya i’m gonna start to try and put effort into it now i dont have to worry abt college n shit now
Fair
If you have any questions just direct them at me, leo, jack or ben
Oscar has done a little too
thank you bro!
All good
have you got any youtube account recs?
I have made 
2 maps (one for you, one to tell me more specific info)
3 variants to existing enemies that work better for the situation 
1 dedicated NPC
A magic item 
A spell to make the magic item work
A feat (I had to make separate feats for each option)
And I think that’s it
Pointy hat and the fantasy forge are good
Jesus
hell yeah
It took 3 days
I’m not doing any homebrew for mine
ty
Most advice i’ve seen is to minimise that
So thats what im doin
And I had to learn how to use the homebrew through the website 
With bad internet
Good job ig
Y’all got my mediocre sessions to beat so good luck
It hurt so much
Tbf 
All I did for the enemies is just add a weapon
Because it’s old content and I wanted them to have guns
Yay guns
Guns are cool
The wonderful world of homebrew
ohhhh this is hurting my head
Yeah im gonna wait out on that one buddy
It’s even worse when the page deletes your progress cuz signal dropped out when you tried to save
Copy and paste became a godsend
You were warned to use notes then paste it over <This message was edited>
Do y’all want me to post character guidelines for my session or should i wait a lil longer?
Sooner would be better
Alright i’ll type it out
Bet
Nvm im posting a screenshot
These are the classes and races in the eberron setting
thank you!
Yw broseph
Some background
cooking some things up rn
finally making a characters doc not sure why i haven’t done ts before
Broþir
Why😭😭😭
i literally have a doc for everything and every character i’ve ever made ever so i literally couldn’t tell y why i haven’t made one yet
You’re a party of slightly experienced adventurers currently living paycheck to paycheck in sharn, the city of spires
like i’m a writer damnit what am i doing with my life 🫩🫩
Idk
Not writing
awesome sauce
clearly..
i’ll blame college
I write all my session notes out in word
Helps me keep track of goals, characters and the like <This message was edited>
that’s probably a smart thing to do
i should do that too
Good idea
damn i’m a noob at ts shit
Stans dming tbf
been doing ts shit for 10 months too like??
Also means i can have the web app for dnd beyond up at the same time so i can consult my source
I’m not that good at it tbf
is dnd beyond down or is my signal
bad
You signal
You’re signal is down
damn
There have been power outages across the county
I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s related
luckily
i’m not in the country 😈
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
I’ll tell my mates to warn the sheep
Nerd
Stan pinned a message
oh shi
This is offensive to my welsh heritage
Good
The scotsman in me is also offended
Oh there’s plenty to offend about the Scottish
@William Stothard lemme pin things!
Wdym
I can’t pin messages
Yeah you can
Thanks broseph
Idiot
Nerd
what level are we doing?
5th
thanks
Its at the top of the pic but its a lil covered
ya ya just wanted to make sure
Its all good
Forgor to add humans to the race list
They are also available
hey gang does it make sense for a tiefling to be a ranger or
Yeah any race can be any class, doesn’t have to be stereotypical
alrighty thanks
okay i’ve got my basic ideas and inspo photos n my head around the technical stuff to an extent
gonna write her up tonight
yay
Alr whatcha doin
tiefling ranger
should be exciting
Bet
infernal legacy
Hook me up with backstory asap so i can write it in
oh shi lemme cook ts up properly  bro
give me few hours
I will
to ponder and develop
i will once i’ve figured it out tho!
I can suggest reading the eberron book on dnd beyond just to get a sense of the source
alrighty thanks
is it free
okay i got it
i’ll download it
I can recommend the same to all of you
sorry to ask but what were our circumstances again?
You are all adventurers with a small amount of experience but have taken up residence in the city of sharn due to the expensive nature of adventuring as a lifestyle
Some of you may be natives to the city
Others may originate from elsewhere
okay thank you :D
Stan pinned a message
Btw @Stan I can’t do Wednesday but maybe I can do Thursday my parents are just asking for a few more details about where and when
At my place
Normal dnd times
We can do Thursday
thursday we lose someone

Yeah we lose will
There isn’t a day we’re all available
So either will or leo is gonna have to sit this one out
Also haven’t got anything from @Oscar Hunt Brown yet
i COUlD be free friday at the cost of no drinks and leaving early
We would still be missing dakota though
hmm
friday wouldn’t be ideal for me

And so scheduling conflicts become the death of DnD
💔
WAIT
Honestly we’re gonna have to lose somebody
What
not going my dads on friday
blud is abroad i forgot
Can dakota do friday?
We’re also missing votes from jack and oscar
Which could shift the answer
it could
someone call their asses
@Jack Payne @Oscar Hunt Brown 
We need input from you goobers

We’re tryna schedule a day
Cool

Istfg if jack doesn’t get in here imma go to his house

Which subvariants of 
Elves 
Dwarfs

Also what days are you free next week
Jus the base game ones
All
I forgor there were non base game ones my dude
the decision still has to be made stan 💔
Ik who i’d vote for but i’ll make it your problem
You need to remember that you guys are essentially my entire friend group
Also the all is to when I’m available
@William Stothard and @Leo come defend yourselves
make ur case type shit
Convince the party who should be included
Voting shall begin after both arguments are made
I’ve spent the last like 10 minutes figuring out what was going on
LMAO
Also going to my house would be pointless 
I’m in Whitby
they’re getting voted out ts is so funny
among us type shit
You still need a house to come back too
Fr fr
Why cant we do Friday?
Dakota isn’t available
no dakota
I vote Will
Leo has dice to give me <This message was edited>
tbf doesn’t that mean all three have to make their case?
Voting hasn’t started yet
Fair
if it’s between three days
@Dakota defend yourself
Meh idrm
Booo
Fuck you
that’s NOT  strong defence
Try harder
It wasn't a defence
Alright in this essay i will…
Leo isn’t even defending himself so he’s losing so far
I live for the benefit and profit of 2 people
Hahaha wiseguy
Twas venting my dissatisfaction
Right think about it
Anyone who doesn't allow me to be there
Is gay
guys icl it is literally going to be in his house
Too late
it’d be a bit dodge to not include him
shi💔
Openly bi so my previous statement still stands
He is going out with friends
Yeah
I dont see them often
fair point
Voting shall now begin
Alright I have a better argument
POLL:
Chose your sacrifice
OPTION: Leo (3 votes)
OPTION: Will (1 vote)
OPTION: Dakota (1 vote)
LMAOO LEO HASNR WVEN DEFENDED??😭
Imagine having friends other than this small group of people
Why not Friday? @Dakota
If you include me, I’ll download DRG
That's cuz im older cuh
Pack for scout camp
All day?
college widens ur connections
Why not the day before
Indeed
Pack on Thursday
(i have u guys and my frisnds from high school im lying)
Networking n shit
Chat leo ain’t defending himself
I don't talk to my high school friends anymore
Idk I may be able to make Friday, but it is a week long camp, straight into a whole month of other camps
Thank fuck
chat i’m not voting for ts it’s so mean
Pussy
It is the only way
love it
Gay?
Uhh, biologically speaking yes
the rumours would say so
Bullshit all college gave me was a cult
I want a cult
Is that not a wider horizon
Alr chat we’re scheduling for Wednesday
Yay
I get to be there
Actually, considering leo has missed so many dnd sessions
Do Thursday
He has his own session the next week it’ll be fine
Nah bro
Do it
Guess I’ll just have to wait even longer to get my 
I’m quoting Leo here 
‘Cum dice’
They’re white enamel with gold writing
Cum dice
And for the record, any and all decisions made have been made without my own personal beef with leo in mind
We’ll do Thursday if will wants to sacrifice himself
Breaking news: Jack wants Leo’s cum
Whoa whoa whoa
Gay?
yo ?
What
Why 
Just 
Why
Not unusual
I don’t hear denial
Ik bros bi but <This message was edited>
Leo?
Feel like bro can score a better twink than that
someone fill me in pls
On what
I want my own set of dice 
I can’t be bothered to get any 
And that’s the set that Leo is willing to give me
The polish femboys have learnt to stay away now
Not the polish femboys 😭
ts
Jack is bi
Leo is bi
Jack is getting “cum dice” from leo
White enamel with gold writing
Dakota shortened to “jack wants leos cum”
I’m saying that while jack is bi he could do better
No real reason for that im just a bullying my best mate
Overwatch?
George is ready
Maybe in a sec
Still doin some writing
Yeah in a couple mins
@ceylan get all that?
i think so
something abt cum dice
Yep pretty much
Stan get will on
Or maybe will should get will on
Mayhaps
Huh
So to round out dnd is on Thursday <This message was edited>
Make characters
Keep me updated
okay
Ok
This Thursday or one after?
Feel free to dm me character backstories if it isn’t for the party yet
One after
Next week
Cool
so who got voted out?
Will volunteered as tribute
Will
damn
katniss moment
Stan, get on
Holup im writing
You should be gamin
You want a session or nor
I do
Improv time
Then lemme write bitch
It can only carry me so far
play juno for me guys❤️‍🩹
No
i gotta get the bus to ibstock💔
kms
Do not bring juno-raka into this
i wanted that skin so bad
was so tempted to fork out the 22 quid
what specifically within the eberron book would you like us to read
cos there’s a lot
Btw @Stan 
What backgrounds are we allowing 
Same again with just Eberron and  core 3 books
Eberron sources and the phb
what’s pub
phb
Players handbook
okok
Dms guide too
Core 3 means PHB DMG and MM
wait it’s occuring to me maybe this wasn’t a response to me
it is definitely not
help!
Just read all of it
shi🫩
Just the character creation but
Bit
The base story
Though focus on info relating to Sharn probably
And maybe a lil bit on sharn
If you character would know more info on sharn definitely
Who’s hopping on
solid
cheers
Also is gunslinger allowed
No
Refer to the class and race list that is pinned
While firearms exist in eberron they are not very advanced and were not considered as thoroughly as weapons of war
The civil war prefered projectile wands from the likes of artificers
There will be powder and ball firearms but they are simple and “outdated” by modern standards
Any other questions
sadly i cannot build my character tonight because signal does not allow for the character builder to open
Same
I’m gonna try anyway but still
ts may sound silly but how am i doing ability scores if ive got no dice with me
praying for you
mine loaded eventually
Digital roll?
I’m gonna use my iPad since that has a stable connection to the online version
ah right
hey guys is it a crime to use the point buy
Use the dnd beyond rolls
Yes
kms
Are we allowing all of Tasha’s or just access to artificer
@Stan am i alright to send u the character? just to give it  since look over and that
sorry for keep bothering u lowkey
Sall good
how do i share a character i may be being stipid
okay i found it nvm
Everyone follow ceylans example and make _legitimate_ backstories for characters since this is intended as a campaign
No gag characters
Yo can anyone forward the link to Leo's campaign
Can't access artificer rn
He’ll have to link it for you
@Leo yo a hand bro?
https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/join/68396253190460516
Nvm chat i found it
@stan are we allowing all of tasha’s cauldron or just artificer access
You didn’t answer
Yeah tasha’s is fine since its mostly optional class features
Ayo @Jack Payne what kinda artificer you making?
Battle smith
Been at beach signal was naff <This message was edited>
Also
@ceylan 
How to you send someone your character sheet since I can’t figure it out and you apparently have
it’s like
wait
let me ss
I meant more like your personality/plastyle
so it’s on the settings thing of your character page and press export to pdf
Oooooh
Still working that part out
and then copy link
Oh k
Yeah cuz im also doing artificer
But im doing artillerist
So I’m gonna have to wait since I don’t enough internet to do that
Got it
ya i had to wait ages for it to load too
I have the extra issue of I can only get it to even try to do that on my iPad
And I don’t have WhatsApp on my iPad
Womp
put the link in like a doc or something then grab it on ur phone
if you get me
copy paste link from ipad into doc or notes, go on phone and copy paste link to whatsapp
Still would take like half hour and I can’t be assed to do with it
fair
Right few things for @Stan session

1. Is it happening tomorrow
2. ⁠@Oscar Hunt Brown are you willing to take me
3. When should I be at yours
Sure
1. No its next week
When
Thursday
Sessions is at standard DnD times so
Also everyone going can use my campaign and @Stan I’ll bring my laptop so you can do dm shit on the campaign
+I’ll bring my dm shit
Like the dice you owe me
Or said you’d give
1 of 20
I still need to rig those
So how much of the Eberron source book has everyone read so far
Nat 1’s all round
Kidding
I’ve read most of the stuff on the way to chapter 2
It’s a lot of stuff
Also 
And I’m already sorry for saying it 
Is Aundair just France 
I have to ask
No its next week
I have my own laptop
Also can everyone give me a lil tidbit on what they would like form this campaign long-term
Factions to join
Ratio of combat to roleplay
The like
wholesome and meaningful interaction and role play me thinks
Mkayy so 70% of the population are refugees but i’ll try and work with that
what does that even mean bro🫩
There was a civil war that destroyed most of the nations
It canonically ended 2 years ago
But do y’all wanna focus on being successful adventurers or renowned warriors
Street criminals
Poor?
Idk im just tryna gauge what to write long term
it depends on the story and the dynamic between characters surely?
I’ll ask again after the sesh dw
idk tho
Not with my account you don’t
Tbf the civil war only really destroyed Cyre.
The others were damaged a shit tonne but not destroyed
Also I don’t think can make ppl dms on that campaign
What does he need your account for?
lowkey he can just log in to yours if he needs
We can all look at the character sheets
True but only my account and edit things / give you things
Right
I’m not sharing my account thank you
But my account can edit and give me things
Ok but then he has to tell you to do that
Ok?
It’s easier if he can do it himself
DMs exist
It’s not that deep
I’m offering a easier method of him doing something
That doesn’t make him tell you things
Actually I may do it when I’m there
So @Stan only has to  use one computer for notes and dnd beyond shit
Chat
tahC
Frankly there are gonna be very few moments in session 1 where an item just appears in your inventory
I’ll just tell you what you need
Plus then you’ll actually remember you have it
Think how often Ben gives us items compared to how often we actually get items. It’s not often enough to warrant that level of micromanagement
See Dakota gets it
He gets good boy points
@Leo am i correct in assuming that the level 5 air genasi is your character for my campaign or are they separate?
My character for your campaign
Ngl I think everyone should do a thing with your characters on my campaign just do (persons campaign) or (test) at the end of your character name
The only problem is that genasi don’t exist on the planet of eberron
This is once again a recommendation for the whole group to examine the character creation section of the source book
Hey @Stan what items are allowed
Im assuming no magic ones
No magic items
Equipment items within reason
You are lightly experienced
I had a question about artificer in eberron, it looks like there’s the three subclasses but no armourer?
Yes
Omg are we gonna have 3 artificers
But the next eberron source includes armorer
So im allowing armorer
Also are humans allowed? They aren’t specified on the image you sent
Also im also only allowing 2 of each class
Stan forgot them
But yes
Yeah i forgor
Cool
Darn
Sorry dakota
Snooz u lose
If you are confused on allowed races check the “races of eberron” section of the book
Dwarves are allowed yeah?
Yes
Sick
So what we got so far then
2 artificer 1 ranger and a monk?
A fighter too
Ooh yay
Who’s the monk?
Idk leo?
Or was he thr fighter
Hes the fighter
Ahh got ya
Who needs casters anyway
Ingenuity supremacy
With a team comp like that I might have to go religious or support
Yeah i mean im on healing turret for arti
But yeah some support would be nice
Might I suggest cleric? Or paladin
Very probably, and we don’t have enough levels to bother multiclassing
Oml
You can just play purebred you know 😭😭😭
Especially in the first 5 levels 😭😭
I’ll have to
But damn it’s just so limitingggg
WDYM
THE GAME CAN BE FUN ON ITS OWN YK
I like being versatile
Multitool type shi
You have teammates for that
Be good at one thing
Let your friends pick up the dlack
Slack
You can be versatile within 1 class
Its what subclasses are for
A jack of all trades is a master of none
"But often better than a master of one" does not apply here btw
Alright alright I’ll try being a single for once
Good
Be religious
Break some heathen heads
(Preferably not mine)
Dw chat he likes it
I dont
My head has suffered enough
So much has gone down whilst I was at the beach
Jesus
Yep
Whoa nice masks
I’m sewing on patches 😭
Oooh books
Ts hurts my fingies
OOOH SHOW ME INCE UR DONE
Y oh have to be better at it than me
I managed to sow a circular patch onto a straight line
i’m ngl if you can sew them like genuine i’m willing to pay you to do mine
i have zero skill with it
I have experience
But im doing it through leather rn
damn
that’s hard
Which is even worse
Speaking of leather
Guess who just bought a  half metre of leather
oh?
why
Shield
damn
Ja
I also got a book as well
what book
Age*
ooh
Im a history nerd what can i say
hell yeah
can’t blame i
you
I also got pretzels
Cuz Leicester and shi
yum yum
Indeed
You better bring enough pretzels for the whole class
yeah cmon will
No?
Im not made of money
This was my lunch bro
How about you get yo gee ee ahh, outta the fucking house for once
Goomba
Bro im out every day
I have the shitty financial records to show for it
Yeah I was in Leicester yesterday, didn’t get no pretzels
okay bro no need to flex
🫩
What patches you need doing?
dude i got so many
i got about 30 i collected up from vinted to put onto my trousers and then two new things
so a vest and a jacket
it’s a big job and i CANNOT sew for the life of me
What material
denim vest and just oike
ordinary fabric jacket
I’m thinking of taking commissions
hell yeah
business times
Had to rub dirt in to make it match the 30 year old surroundings
We need a patch haul
hell yeah
‘aged’
Shh
Dirt and sandpaper
they will age on their own bro i swear 🫩
Yeah but they have 30 years to catch up on
I can’t have an inconsistent garment
Yes you can, that’s the whole point of an evolving item
Yeah but im not looking for an evolving garment
I’m matching an era
fair bro
what other patches are you planning on putting on it
I’m not sure yet
Probably some band patches
And a few more flags
And some famous motorcycle manufacturers
hell yeah
awesome sauce dude
Decision time guys, Dragonborn paladin or shifter paladin?
dragonborn
Cool there’s like 7 different Dragonborn, before even starting on which colour
Shifter
There cooler imo
silver
Dakota is not happy go lucky tho
dakota is not their character
Indeed
Ngl I find it hard to create and remember to act as anyone other than essentially me, maybe with some small changes
Do drama then
damn (me too)
the sister meant to be stoic and nonchalant but that ain’t me
Yeah that's me ngl
I attract enough drama as is, don’t need no more
i’ve done it again that’s the thing
my new character
is quiet
Ich bin ein
like tf ? who am i kidding ?? <This message was edited>
i cannot do that??
what is THAT
Yeah that’s not you
nope
Ein hotdog
No, that is an abomination
nope 👎
Du bist ein frankfurter?
Ja ein, hotdog
Chat do i have to do some fuckin improv classes for you so you can learn to play characters or sm
no i just gotta remember to lock in
Legitimately could be helpful, but also remembering continuity is hard
Its literally just chronological memory tf
Ok lemme rephrase, remembering to use the continuity at all times is hard
Ok watch some videos on acting
That will probs help
Either way that doesn’t help with the decision to be thick or breathy
What
What the fuck are on about
Ok so there are ways to deal with this
Some come from me as a dm
Others are all you
Fail to plan, plan to fail
Species
Play shifter fr fr
Species of wjat
We haven’t had one before
Oh shifter
There fun ngl
Furries?
Temporarily
Whatever sounds like your character the most ngl
Comicon type shi
comicon bro
They all have like little descriptions that show what kinda animal they are like so just read yk
was so dead last year
Womp
maybe that was cos i did f wear glasses OR prescription contacts and was rendered blind or day
didnt*
HA
maybe i just missed all the fun
How blind is bro
dude i never realised how bad it was until that day
Lets get the dnd group out next year
wore contacts and glasses as part of my cosplay so couldn’t wear my own and literally couldn’t see SHIT
YESSS
PLS
i dragged my mum with me
and my sister
who do not fw ts kinda stuff
Question is on whether we cosplay ot not
That's too fuckong bad
(although i have forced my mum to watch a few anime’s)
YES OBVS
Oh god
we should cosplay our own characters
she enjoyed dw
Magic turtle?
How tf do I do that
imagination buddy
Imagine this imagine that, how bout you imagine yourself on a date fr
Gods
oh
Dayum
Sorry
damn
kms ?
No?
Did I say that?
that’s what i heard
Twas just being fecious
Misheard then
Cuz that was not the intention
Will just go to comicon as Eivor varinsdottir or sm
YES
We don’t need to cosplay our characters
Dottir
Dottir????

Perish?

Thats like the tutorial my guy

impossible bro
You overthrew many kings, avenged your father and mother and killed a ragnarsonn, the best one as well
Game is fucking good
ain’t worth allat bro
Of you fw history its bangin
If
the only thing i was remotely interested in was that one guy who had went from bad to good to bad again and then when eivor killed him idgaf
Chat can we go back onto the convo of who we’re cosplaying
Ivarr?
i believe so
The boneless
Ivarr is fucking sick ngl
i liked him  a lot and when i found out he killed the kid i genuinely cried
sobbed at his death too
Genuinely one of the best scenes with him
SAME
MY BABY BOY CEOLBERT 😭😭😭😭
I KNOWWW
You also cried at Edgerunners
did you let him have an honourable death
I think you’re just a lil emotional ngl
BRO DID NOT DESERVE THAT
your point?🫩
Yes

Good

Sick bastard or not
popular opinion is i’m the opposite
Uh huh
Ivarr earned his seat in valhalla
good good
I threw bro off of 2 cliffs
Rip Ceolbert gang

And got tackled into some mushrooms to barely live
I foraged that shit mid tackle
To win the boss fight on first try

Cuz im the goat
i legit spent the whole game swapping between easy and the normal mod
Nah
i never persevere in boss fights so if i lose once i just switch to easy bro
Medium all the way except for stealth
not a fan of combat
I ran hard mode for exploration
jesus
And medium for combat
what?

Cuz im the goat
top ten ways to ruin a game

Never played it
Bro shut up
Literally the best viking game out there

Name a better one

Not a viking game
That's just medieval Iceland bro
Valheim?

Fair
Valhalla is still better imo
the plot is so boringgg bro
it just dragged for so long
you were chasing down the guy for ages
and he was being all mysterious and secretive
Your a Greek God, who fucked a hippy giant, there is no relation to the norse other than setting
and i just stopped giving a fuck!
he did not fuck no hippie giant bro..
Which guy?
The lost vikings arcade cabinet made by blizzard from 1993?? 🥺

Oh the jötnar were just misunderstood my ass
Laufaye
sigurd i think
Your brother?
I forgot about him tbh

and then what is there
Atreus' mother bro
we didn’t meet her bro

her size may have been bigger than human BUT
You burn her corpse?
oh
She was 12ft tall
at ghe beginning
That giant
i forgor
she most certainly did not screw him in her giant form
i really hope anyways
No that was her giant form
Jotnar vary
Drastically
in the blankets??
that was just a normal sized body was it not??
Compare kratos to them
i’m so confused ts was like last year i barely remember
She is huge
idk bro i don’t remember
why was atreus so teeny tiny then
i hated him so so bad
She big bro
idk bro
she could have just been like
slightly tall
6 foot queen maybe
LOOK AT HER
Kratos is 7?
This corspe is like 4 ft taller than him
hmm..
She was a jötun 😭😭😭
hmmm…
She lived in jötunheim 😭😭😭
hmmm….
She was champion of the jötnar
She is the mother to literal loki
That famous jötun
Chat this is a lot of arguing just to confirm that kratos likes muscle mommy’s
Like get it over with already
Yeah that's fair
Laufaye>aphrodite
Uh huh
She's only twice my height chat
Only
This is a very telling conversation
Like this isn’t stuff we already knew about will

Dropped my phone on myself

Wait till y’all hear the ironic bit of that dream job
yeah?
Stan is siniphobic
Sino*
Cynophobic
i???
That's it
what???
Angua vibes
what is this
The innate fear of canines
doesn’t this mean he hates chinese people orrr
oh
so you’re scared of dogs and you want to handle a professional aggressive dog
Yes
this is insane btw
He will be mine to command
Exposure therapy
Plus i’ve punched through my phobia anyway
Your telling me
you’re scared of them???
I’m chill now
you’re
sorry
but yes
that’s insane stan
Im just as amazed as you arr
tbf i’m no different
i wanna be a teacher and i don’t like kids sooo
we’re twinning i think
We would struggle to go anywhere because of dogs
And now the mf wants one
damn
Ig watching the dog which terrorised me as a child lose his leg to cancer really helps /J
🤨
Stfu stan
I’m joking obvs
is bro okay
Boris was lovely
Boris was a saint ill here none about it
He was sooo nice
origin story type shit
I’m sad i got over it after he got euthanised
I truly am
He was a black labrador with the biggest smile on his face always
don’t feel bad abt that bro my dog died in march and even tho i loved him sooo much i got over it so fast
it’s just what happens
He was amazing i loved him
aww
bless
And he didnt shed to much
As in i got over the phobia
oh
damn
🫩
But he had cancer and and was like 13 in human years
He was old
jeez
wait this may be insensitive to the conversation at hand
Our grandpa had two german shepard attack dogs back in deutschland
act like i sent it at a better time
I wanna carry on the tradition fr fr
jesus
He was a policeman
He needed em
carrying on the legacy
Gurl you are the toes
Big old bloke as well
NO
Like bro is the only guy In our family talle than me
There is none to rival him
Eotenisc as we would say
He’s 6’4 isnt he?
Sumn like that
Can't tell tbh
And unlike me he has the muscle to back up his height
I see 3
Also 
Why is shy guy classed as a dog
Idk
You sly dog
Thats what they think he is ig
The syndrome meme, the 2 helldivers screenshot and the one talking about ceylans dead dog
And shy guy
he’s dead cuh
And that stupid fucking bird from new Zealand
insane screenshot
Mb cuh
Plus birds and another screenshot
The 2 helldivers ones both have some variant of guard dog
Specifically the bolt variant
Kiwi
Also you forgot the cat
That's not a kiwi mate
Kiwis have fatter bodies
Fruit
And smaller feet
Way harder to find
I have too many helldivers memes
Aw there he is
Wth will
Ngl, @Jack Payne  kinda looks like Poz
Not really
do not insult my heritage like that
/s
Tbf his wife was in the air force was she not
both of them where
but i've seen poz
Chat
Gotta get real
Nah
Stay fictional
The fat cat is gonna turn your internals into lasagne
So chat who has actually made or atleast concieved a character for each campaign happening soon
Both mine and leo’s
yes me bro!
Congrats you get a gold star <This message was edited>
yipee :3
There is definitely the stats of a character for your campaign, I have no clue about Leo’s or if I’m even like actually in it
Yesnt
I have a general idea
Ik jack has a complete character
And leo needs a backstory
Chat i’m deadass bored as fuck, someone say something funny or controversial
All of you who have read this and said nothing are cowards
We also need someone else to say it, bc we have no clue what to say
One can only watch so many bmw specs videos and remain sane
Do i have to add fucking Ben to babysit us?
Nah I’m just too busy w anime and picking spells
Don’t be a buzzkill
okay i can probably conjure something  controversial
hmm
The point of this chat was to escape his judgement
No it was to let lilly enjoy her childhood innocence a little longer
okay i don’t have anything
i back this
this is why this was made
i think upon the penis photo being sent
I’m just gonna say it
KFC is ass and idk why anyone would eat it
I agree
Tbf this take is colder than most kfc
yo..
Nah, colder than most McDonald’s
go to anywhere but coalville kfc and ur mind will change
Nope
I’ve been to a few
have you even sunk your fangs into a rice box ?
500 calorie takeaway option peak
Idk how chicken can be greasy and drt
Nah I’ve been to Loughborough kfc and it’s nearly as bad
I’m not a rice guy
mk..
Rice is great
I prefer pasta
no no no
pasta is overrated as FUCK
Dont even
Pasta is better, most Italian food is
that’s my contraversial take
Tucking into some tagliatelle is gorgeous
i would chose most foods over pasta
nope nope
pasta will always be my last choice
oh..
Are you sure we should value your taste?
i didn’t like it🫩🫩🫩🫩🫩
Omg all of stfu
Im trying to sing Swedish rn

Last song of the night btw
Yayyy
Can you guess what it is stan?
POLTAVA🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🍻🍻🍻🍻
Well thats too fucking bad
Guys i have a really deep mental health issue i need to be clear about
@Jack Payne and @Dakota will never look the same at me again
Ok?
Oh I think I may like where this is going
I may have, against better judgment
Become a volunteer police cadet
Oh no
You fucking what
Not at all where I thought that was going
Hehehe
What did you think?
Dakota 
Do you still have the number for that asylum you tried to send me to
I thought you were going to join us
No never
I’m not that square
You are square stan
You weren’t the last, so I have them on speed dial now
Got it
Yeah i’m gonna be a pig now chat
I didn’t know how to tell you guys
And ik this may come as a shock
BAT FASTARD
Me, Jack, and many more are there. What makes you think we’re straight enough to be squares
Expect to see me at public events
Honestly, I’m glad someone reputable will be known at the police cadets
I’ll whip em into shape
Make them something to be proud of
Okay maybe not that far
That’s a lot of shape to whip, and knowing her she’ll probably like it
There are so many things wrong and right about that sentence
Thankfully she’s not there anymore
I think
Nah she’s been seen in London for a while now
Sleep tight pookies 💋
Just what I’d expect from a police cadet
Shh
I’m just in it for the dress uniform
I finally get to iron sleeves and crease trousers
Hallelujah
Again, much better in the air
We have two sets of sleeves to iron, and a set that you don’t
Oh wait we have a session tomorrow
Damn we should really sleep
Yeah but then i’d have to be one of you petrol pidgeons
Well technically yes but also no
Better than a plastic nee naur
Nuh uh
I have to join st johns for my T level anyway
Atleast im not navy tho
It can always get worse
So join ambulance cadets?
Yeah thats what im doing
I’m doin em both
Unfortunately thats what she said
I DID EVERYTHING FOR HER
I can’t decide if that makes you better or worse
Its just something to do to get me experience for university
And a chance to try something new
But atleast im not you guys
If i also joined you i’d have cadets 4 straight nights a week
I see no problem with that
Unfortunately a man can only stand at ease for so many hours before his spine is powder
Your ex army and fresh police, there’s not much spine to begin with
Fair
At least you can steal one from the ambulance
Atleast i don’t have to worry about my shirt forming a right angle any more
Damn pcs pattern combat shirt
Ha
Last i checked you guys have one each too
Not pcs
Your greens?
We’re a mix of dpm or mtp
The mtp ones are pcs
Depending what stock they can get
Oh
*Personal Clothing System*
Thats my quartermaster autism flaring up tho
Ofcourse the army name things like Americans
Wdym by that
Atleadt we don’t call them BDUs or some such nonsense
Acronyms fuel the army
PCS
PLCE
AN/PRC
They do, but at least pick good acronyms
PRR
FUBAR
All of those are real acronyms and have actual meanings
I swear
I believe you
Your autism woudknt allow you to lie about that
But which is the odd one out????
FUBAR
Nope
One is a designation
The other 4 are equipment
FUBAR is the only one I know, and it is not a specific piece of equipment
An army trooper has no better piece of equipment at his disposal than swearing at his squaddies
Its AN/PRC
It means Army Navy Personal Radio Communications
Autism over
Goodnight
Goodnight
dude these caravan beds leave me more tired upon waking
i’m going to end my life
What's so different

Maybe you shoulda just changed courses before it started then
i absolutely should have
i mean i DID start with alevels
And you dropped out
yeah🫩
It sounds like working at McDonalds is the next step
Damn
Rude much

Nah building your houses mate
So you can hide your men
And so what? We’re proud of who we are
Considering they ain't got owt to do now that pits closed
There’s always pub
Trip down spoons
There's like 19 pubs in Coalville none of which are good
Big ups queens

@ceylan what is your problem with bayerische motoren werke aktiengesellschaft?
this is my problem
What?
🫩
Stan stop being such a dich
What is wrong with bayerische motoren werke?
Its just a company
It can’t hurt you
Except for that one boeing thing
Bachpfeifengesicht
Apart from the hole to get your fingers stabbed
Oh yeah mb
Any of you willing to contribute a large chunk of high carbon steel?
Preferably with free shipping?
You could always twin me?
That's sick until the point where I drop the shield and die
Could you form essentially a leather bowl reinforced with curved strips of wood?
Or, wooden bowl
Not great against any real dmg my man
hey idk if you noticed but someone took a bite out of your cool shield
Yeah its called rotted wood
Im not made of money
you might wanna tell them not to take a bite
Mb chat i was hungry
It looked mighty scrannable <This message was edited>

LIGHT THE BEACONS
Marvel rivals?
Nah
Apex legends
Oh god that’s worse
Yes but...
Fair
Would be me asf, but im not a degenerate
I feel like we need @ceylan opinion
hi
Good point
who is THIS
That is loba from apex legends
Can you give me her number please
She was always the built, but this is the first time they have showed it off
That*
hell yeah
baddy gyal
a ceylan opinion can come btw let me cook
What
Wtf
ts
let me think
someone give me a prompt
*Boob-tality*
WHAT
Nothing brings a male friendgroup together better than tiddies ig?
Damn she typing up a storm
okay opinion incoming due to my circumstances : 
love island is a a really damaging programme that demeans love and places great emphasis on physical appearance attraction and sex within a relationship and desensitises young people to shit and gives young people a false impression of what natural human bodies should look like and it’s literally just a show based on glorifying ‘drama’ and casual cruelty and promiscuity which is overall just ver damaging on young people going on to form relationships with themself and other people
yur
Honestly real
Except for the part where you missed some commas
stfu
my family love love island but it pmo so bad
It just seems fake <This message was edited>
It’s a horrible show
it’s so bad
yeah man
Like lets be honest would you rather have meeting your soulmate be televised or private?
We more meant an opinion on woman tho
Bro really cranked out the “who asked”
private
oh!
As if there are any soulmates on there, the viewers decide half the shit
Fair
“I think i lo- brad the viewers said you gotta fuck the latina instead”
Type shi
literally
it’s all just for idle gossip and drama and messing with peoples feelings
like who the fuck thinks love can actually be found thru the audience voting the couples ??
Or as some people call it
High school
The audience
clearly
Thats about it
Now if you want a good show about dating, watch love on the spectrum
real
Its about autistic people delving into dating
As bowling for soup said, “high school never ends”
Both funny and endearing
i’ve dabbled
it’s sweet
My gf makes me watch it
Idk if she’s tryna say sm
i feel bad bc sometimes i think people watch it to make fun
and that does not sit right with me at all
I don’t
You can look em up
Most of them are still dating
Some are even married
yeah i’ve seen they’re very sweet
clips n that
I feel bad for one dude cus his parents are basically ruining his chances by constantly picking on him for the show
Bro just tryna talk to women
Chat y’all ever just enjoy a nice refreshing glass of water
Nah I just crunch on some raw ice <This message was edited>

idk you said we
Bout to say we?
Nuh uh
wtf is that
jabba the hut ahhh
Me asf on Thursday
it’s me bro
IT WAS OMFG
😝
white ass mf tongue 🫩
also dyeing my hair today so stay excited ladies
Omg yay ✨✨✨✨🥺
🧑🏻‍🎤
Wtf
😑
What color?
One of them i suppose
No fucking shit smartass
What next
The ocean is wet
🧑🏻‍🎤
I’m assuming green then
That shit is black on my phone
Common andriod L
There is no way for humans to detect moisture, or any degree of "wetness"
Will just stop being a jackass for once
Im being a smartass not a jackass
I am doing nothing to insult you
ngl tho there is
if it makes my hand wet
then it’s wet
Ahh but what constitues wetness?
the feeling
What does it feel like tho?
Cold yes?
put ur hand in some water and tell me bro
no
hot water
only doing a little strip
But neither cold water or hot water feels the same
The permeation of liquid particles through the top layers of skin?
There is no unifying trait between the 2
They do not permeate
surely there’s gotta be an osmos explanation somewhere here
That would defeat thr point of skin
osmosis
We do not undergo osmosis on our dkin
Skin*
under
in our body n shit
Oh yes certainly
But we do not feel that do we?
bros a hater
Also will, skin permeation is a thing
Nay
It is how needleless injections function
Go on
As to allow intravenous injection
Ok so read the word you just said
Intravenous
Intra meaning in
Venous meaning vein
Indeed
ngl like
patches andahit
hormone patches
nicotine patches
permeates into the skin
The shit is still in your veins despite being needless
And how does it get there?
Through electricity typically
Used to charge the particles of said drug
Allowing it to permeate your skin
But it requires an outside force to do so
Unlike osmosis or simple diffusion
Of which our skin does not allow
As to protect us from common waterborne pathogens
biology alevel ahhh 6 mark answer
A LEVEL BIOLOGY BITCH
That would be 12 at least
Ngl
💪
BUT
Bro gonna nuh uh me fr
the later of skin which is waterproof is the stratum corneum
Which isn’t the top layer
My original statement only mentions the top layers
Holup nvm
Stan the top layer is like 1 ųm thick
And? <This message was edited>
My statement is still correct
Hmm?
Additionally can’t the water enter through the sweat pores
No?
That would also invalidate the point of sweat
And more importantly this argument is a stupid roundabout way of you being a smartass cus i called you captain obvious
Indeed
Difference being
I remember this from memory
Congrats ig?

Well I’ve been told to move now
Why is Oscars mother on the move
I got told to go back where I was
Alr long as your all good
And now my dads pissed I moved <This message was edited>

Ok so what happened last night?
Cripple camp has just been so funny
We were in a cave up a mountain, and on the way back there was a girl wiser than Ceylan who fell over into a bog
Her legs were stuck up to both knees
WHAT
unnecessary mention🫩
holy shit
Be glad I didn’t @ you
🤺🤺🤺
Yes be glad that i only mentioned you by name
But it was relevant to get a sense of her true wiseness
r we talking
wide or wide here gang
WISE
or wide
She big
🫩
Like trying not to be mean, but whales have been smaller
WHAT
that IS mean
ts poor girl
She’s also very annoying
You don’t seem to be trying very hard
@Stan @Oscar Hunt Brown  when you installed the ram yesterday did you put them both back in the same way?
Yes
I only touched the left stick
K cuz we've got some problems with download speed
do you know what a flashing orange light and a lowered download speed could be
Its the cpu
Power connection issue most likely
Could have spilled thermal paste which could be weakening contacts
apparently it’s just the ethernet so it’s all good
thanks though
we dumb frfr
Alright
@ceylan is will staying over or not?
i think so!
How'd you know
Cus you didn’t answer dad for food
How did the upgrade go?

So that everyone knows, I probably won’t boo on for a while after I get back because my parents are pissed I won’t go in the sea
what😭😭
hope you’re okay dude
I’ll probably be fine
But the options I was given were go in the sea and keep my phone or don’t and not have my phone
Why won’t you go in the sea?
They didn’t like that I said that that was unreasonable
I don’t like beaches
I don’t like sand
fair enough
that’s super unfair :(
Anyways I’ll see you guys later

Anakin mentality
Thats fucking crazy ngl
Not my place to interject
But still...

A* ladies
Woooooooo well done
🎉 well done ong 🎉

Worried for nothing
So drinks are on you right?

You left the quarter of vodka here anyway

Last Tuesday i think

Heavyweight champ here chat
Not my fault you couldn't handle vodka
I was fine ong
Uh huh
Sure thing broseph
Ok so i wasn’t “fine”
But i was ok
Yeah.....
not sure who you’re convincing here buddy
I’m on aboot will chat
Oot and aboot r we stan
To quote our dear grandfather
Indeed
Gang should we have a function round mine next Thursday to celebrate our mediocre at best results?
Indeed
Aight I’ll let my parents know in a bit
Alrighty
Also camp or no?
I can’t tell with the weather rn
Its gonna be one of out last chances to camp
It can’t be too late a function if we do, me and Jack have cadets that night
True
Skip?
Well I mean
Function means sleepover
Could do
That’s how this works
Jack has done so before
Ah I see
I’ve also just realised my parents are going to meet more new people this time as well
Last time they hadn’t met James or river
Atleast 2
Yeah
Also would river want to come again?
Yeah she’ll probably want to
Sick
Alcohol?
Of course
But not while my parents are there
They don’t know yet
Indeed
Leo?
I honestly don’t know
Might be rude since he is in this chat
I don’t see why he can’t come
Sick
Should we setup a poll?
Idk if he’ll check this chat so I’ll dm him later
Yes
Find attendants?
POLL:
Function round mine next Thursday
OPTION: Yay (6 votes)
OPTION: Nay (0 votes)
Also when do we need to be at Ibstock for results?
Idk yet
Ok
Shall i bring the tent again?
Stan pinned a message
Also results are at 8:30 according to my mum
Idk if that’s right
Wicked
Also if weather changes, my mum isn’t chill with ceylan and Dakota staying in the house since she hasn’t met them
Sos guys
Nah that’s understandable
damn
Might be awkward for will
All things considered
can’t i like
meet her
Yeah idk if its gonna be trouble
We can camp regardless of weather with the right preparation anyway
yurp
How so?
Also I just realised that Leo and river are in the same year
Well letting river stay but not ceylan seems kinda unfair
But it is your house
I get it, but I don’t see it being awkward
So your rules are your rules ong
It is what it is ig <This message was edited>
It’ll be fine since we can camp pretty securely this time of year
Ok
i have a tent if we need
like
sleeps ‘4’
but like
2 really
We have one that can sleep 6
With privacy nonetheless
yurp
don’t be tryna imply shit there…
🫩🫩
Dw leo and james were the freaky ones last time
oh
Time to turn it into a group effort
Gang

Gang can I get a rundown on what’s happened in the last week on Minecraft?
Also
Why did nobody tell me you made it a realm?
I have Minecraft on my phone
Leo begged for it
People have built shit
Not much more
I was hoping for slightly more detail
I’ve heard that much from Leo already
There really isn’t anything special
Ok
Houses and a iron farm pretty much
Bridge was upgraded
Proper ways to the mountain
Wall was built
And we have villagers at base
Nice
I might take a look in a bit
Cool
@Oscar Hunt Brown i forgot my laptop for dnd, if you haven’t left yet can you bring yours?
Or a phone charger if not?
Got neither sorry
I have phone chargers, what type do you need?
Lightning is what he’ll need
Easy, sorted
Cool
Oscar stan will need your wireless charger as well then btw
did jack say that he’d cover our sessions ts week bc of our lack of progression last week or did i dream ts
You dreamt that I think
I believe Ben is back this week
Nvm then actually
damn
It is jack you didnt dream it dw
Im just a wee bit dense
i meant like
cover as in
pay
No wait yeah your right
ts is what i like to hear
Cuz they overcharged us last tine
I’m gonna be a smidge late guys
Best quote ever from my sister
‘I didn’t choose this lifestyle. This lifestyle chose me’
Dayum
Right gangsta
Wait Jack has anyone told you what’s happened today?
Nope
But I’m currently busy
You’ll want to hear about what Lily did
She ate a mushroom man alive
And fey bartered, lost, and had her right arm taken
I’m gonna need more context
I’m assuming a Myconid fight
But what about the fey bartering
No fight
Not even combat
Just a random ahh house
Ate a man un provoked
Bartering was for more fungus men as slaves
While Stan was “illusioned” as one of them
They did a coin flip to see if it was Stan that she ate
It was infact illusion magic
I used alter self
Not my shapechanger feature
I have so many questions
And I don’t want to know any of the answers
Why were you after mushroom slaves
Why had Stan illusions himself
Oh and honu being a fatass broke like half the village
Not a group decision, just kinda happened
I had illusioned myself because i was gonna sneak in but then honu’s fat ass broke the balcony
Ah
This is madness
Nope
Simple physics
Also everything is fine
Nobody has gained medical insanity
I finally used the magic on the armour I got from grogs championship
What did it do
The levitate spell - armour of weightlessness
Neat
Bc it’s a treetop village, so a couple of us took falling damage
Good thing I wasn’t there I think
You woulda been fine
No serious combat
literally only finished combat from last session and honu fought a slime
And won mind you 💪
Im only 240 kg
(W out gear)
With gear you nearly max out a floating disk by yourself
Yeah im only 590 lbs 🥺
Anyone feee to play some overwatch?
Sadly me and ceylan are busy

Ceylan, have you decided on the ruling for magic items for your session? I’m currently assuming none.
none please
Stan
Results day is 8:30 to 10 am
Yeah ik
I’m going at 9:30
Ok
Alright I’ve sorted a way there, is the lift situation any different for getting back tho?
It should be the same
Then @Oscar Hunt Brown I’m going to need a lift home
who tf is demanding for sex to be added😭😭
who is the target audience
MEN
MEN
DWARVED
AND MASCULINE WOMEN
It’s gonna take a couple updates for them to add women
There are female dwarves?
Dwarves are a very ungendered species
Who said it was only dwarves?
POINTY EARED LEAF LOVERS
i would say the dwarves are very male
and if theyre not gendered then i want them to add some feminine ones ANYWAYYY
Well you see
Dwarves just aren't that feminine sadly
Its all beard
Dwarven society has no such concepts as masculinity or femininity
Beard and chainmail
All is dwarf
ROCK AND STONE
video omitted
Gang, will would like to know if you guys have any issues with him. He feels like you guys are being super argumentative with him
I imagine that there’s more context behind it
But he does want to play with you guys and apologises for any misunderstandings
I wouldn’t say so
I have no problems with will at all
I can’t speak for others but i certainly don’t
I’m just relaying his perspective
I wasn’t there
Yeah nah we all good?
I don’t really know him well enough to have much of an opinion
@Oscar Hunt Brown it seems I’m going to need a lift back from you in the morning

But, I have drama on someone who may be getting beat on at 5
Ooh who is it?
Well I don’t wanna be That Guy
But
It’s Reece Athwal for something that could be described by some as minor sexual assault
Others would call it mates joking around
Which is it?
I’d say closer to the side of assault, a dudes head going up a girls jumper unconsentually
That definitely sounds like assault to me
Yeah the boyfriends of some of the girls in class are ‘going to have a word’ with him later today
Ahhh and a free meal from the sounds of it as well
Good old faceful of knuckle sandwich with a side order of kneecap
Well he wasn’t supposed to be back in our class because of it, yet here he is
Sounds like crowd justice is going to take care of it
Not sure to try stick around to watch, no clue where tho
Sounds like stupid got what he deserves
bruh
What
???
?
someone say justice
Ceylan you good cuh? <This message was edited>
i’m so fine
Uh huh
If you say so
Anyone up for helldivers
Yeah lemme boot up around 5
Maybe later, and I need to farm requisition slips if I can for the guard dog
Ok
Well from the looks of things we’ll be on one of Stan’s favourite planet types and my least favourite
The burny one
Also known as Hellmire in this case
The fire tornadoes have been removed while the gloom is present 😔
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS
Good
Those thing made me nearly ficking kms
Thank super earth
Of course it is still unfortunately a gloom strain planet
They’re what made hellmire memorable
Sadness
We didn’t first encounter them on hellmire though Stan 
We first met them where they were even worse for the divers
menkent
I miss menkent too
I don’t
Fire tornados and bots
On the same planet 
Before fire resist armours was nasty
Fuckass planet fr

Getting my reading done
visit the t level if u so desire
i won’t be there but you can still gisit
admire the architecture
I’m not allowed in the exclusion zone

I’m not even on the 16 yet

CHAT
THE SUPER STORE WEAPON FOR DUST DEVILS
IS A FUCKING MACHETE
YEEESSSSSS
Oh that’s super store? Damn
Imma need an extra 500 super credits this time
Cuz the light armour is super store
What’s the passive?
Chat
We’re going worm hunting tomorrow
And it’s gonna be hard
What
I’ve seen clips, apparently there’s a new vehicle?
Hive lords
150k hp
I’m pretty sure the same armour as a leviathan
Meaning only anti tank weapons can scratch it
And for reference
A hellbomb does 10k damage
Shit
Compared to a bile titan we’re basically trying to kill god
How much damage does landing on something do?
Not as much as a hellbomb
And hive lords are *huge*
Like
Bigger than the skeletons we’ve seen
And I don’t know what difficulty they spawn on
I would assume only 7-10
But it might only be 9 and 10
I imagine they’ll be the entire objective
I don’t think they are
With that level of health
You can’t just go and kill one
You have to kit yourself out to slay a hive lord
Remember that every enemy in the game can be one shot by a hellbomb
The hive lord needs an equivalent of 15 to kill it
That’s tomorrows problems for tomorrows divers, for now we need to sleep
The orbital laser does 600 dps
So 18,000 damage total
Ok that’s not too bad
Also who was going to tell me there’s weapon customisation?
Where the squad at? <This message was edited>

But Oscar as a big dude, and Jack is our pwincess according to discord, making him a little thing <This message was edited>

i have accidentally forgotten to cancel the duolingo free trial, charging my mothers account 90£ — if they do not allow me to refund it, i’d be willing if you guys would join the plan and give me like a tenna or smth towards it pretty please
it’s a year plan so it’s worth it gang! (crying, please do it)
I’m tight for cash rn but when i can i will
thank you my choomba
I do not have shmoneys
I’ve got a spare tenner I can give you Saturday

thank you chat

@Oscar Hunt Brown @Jack Payne i have never needed you guys to aid me more than now
@Leo

OKAY YAY

Bet
Anyone up for helldivers
Sure
Chat I just had the WORST fucking lesson of my entire existence
I had personal development
And I have no issues with the lesson
But the teacher
Holy shit
Who was it?
What are they like
She makes me actively want to leap out of a window
Miss Watkins
A walking contradiction
Is she old
No
Ah
But she wants control over a classroom
While the rules she states only work when people respect each other
Welcome to my world with me person
*leeson
She's insecure based off the fact the classroom is the only thing she has control over dam
Yes but also no
The main issue I have is that one of the “rules” is “we do not judge or assume things about people”
So don’t be racist
Fr
Be a good person
But her whole teaching style is based off the assumption that people are willing to discuss the topic at hand and share thoughts
Which I want to do neither
I find her insufferable to the point that I refuse to tell her my full name or form
Real
What’d you say when she asked
So imma ask if I can do psd with jack since I’d otherwise have a free period
Just gave her my first name
Reluctantly
Random but do yk if ewan's tree and bench are still there
No clue
Who is Ewan
My brothers mate who offed himself years ago
Jamie's cousin
They had a tree and bench for him there

Does anyone here like startreck

Hay @Stan I have a friend who may be interested in cyberpunk and you know more about it than me so could I put you in contact with him
What is he tryna do?
Make a character
If he wants to play he can play at the next session
It’ll be easier to help him in person
Btw he would like to play a rocker boy
That’s fine
@Stan could I add him to the discord server
Imma go ahead and vote no on that
Damn that’s a lot
It’s ceylan’s server
Ask her
@ceylan
ya whateva i don’t mind
Is anyone up for helldivers now
Sure
@Leo can you pack your small jbl Bluetooth speaker for dnd tmr?
I would like to use it so we can hear fin better
Yea
Chat
I’m feeling whimsical rn
Why

Ah but you see, it may perchance be entirely justifiable to have used such eloquent vocabulary as perchance
Chat

Go back to sleep River you don’t have good reason to be up this early/late
I can't sleep and I feel like im gonna throw up
So im staying up
Then go throw up and get it over with?
Bitch I did that earlier
Its not as easy as you think it is
Ah
Any reason known for the feeling?
For throwing up or unable to?
Either
Being sick- drank a few over my limit and cried over trauma
Unable to- irrational fear
Ah I see
I lost my glasses
Oh damn that’s not good
Unfortunately function for rivers 16th is a no go since that weekend is my parents wedding anniversary
The week after sends fine if possible
Can we bring it forward?
No because my parents aren’t home
Okayy

gang
somethings wrong
I don’t feel like doing anything anymore
oh
Depression core?
hope you’re okay dude
What's up tho lowk
I hope I am too
probably just a bit burnt out from college maybe?
I’m not sure
take time for yourself and slow shit down and talk to the people around u king fr
What ceylan said fr
It’s more of a lack of motivation to do anything
I hope things start to even out soon tho
I do too
I get you
Like
There are so many things that I want to do
That I can do
That I’ll think about doing
And then not do
I’ve got some maths homework that I need to do
But I can’t bring myself to even find it
I know it won’t take long
And I know it won’t be super challenging
I can't tell you how much i relate to that
And understand what you're going thru
Its a shitty time
Chin up king, shit gets shitty but you can pull through
I just don’t know what to do about this
As always though i gotta do the responsible thing and recommend seeking help from a loved one or professional
Icl writing helped me
I would much rather discuss it with you guys than anyone else <This message was edited>
And
If you want a private conversation without your parents i’d recommend checking the ashby welfare line
I’ve had a major question on my mind
Just write about anything and everything, might be boring at the start but then it helps to get you up to do literally anything
Ask
ya?
Shoot
So
ts helps so good when shits a lot fr
I’ve got two routes I can go down at the moment
One of them is do a shitload at a level then go to uni
The other is do less at a level, and teach myself language models
One gives me money, the other gives me flexibility
honestly do what you think you can achieve with a good mental wellbeing rather than what you can achieve whilst pushing yourself
outcome is the lesser factor if wellbeing is the cost <This message was edited>
No matter what you do, at some point you'll regret it and want to do the other so just pick the one that makes you feel the best
atleast for me anyways
I would recommend working hard at A level, regardless of whether you go to uni or not, the A levels will be valuable regardless of what you do
Worry about what comes next after that
Take a gap year
Travel
Learn those models
But make sure you get atleast useable grades at this point
Ok
discuss with your teachers/tutors in the appropriate subject bc they’ll have good and more tailored advice goo
to*
too
dick
fuck
And ashby has a mental health line ong
yes yes
also there’s no pressure to decide this this year oscar
this year if you just wanna sit in the middle of it all and then next year when you’re exams are you decide
Don’t gotta make it a case or seek permanent healthcare, just yap at a professional for 25 minutes if thats what you want
And if things go wrong then ask for support,  in studies or for mental support
Everyone needs some help sometimes
definitely a canon event to be having a crises when you get to further ed bc it’s literally up to you now and that’s fine yk and as someone who did the exact same thing last year you do not need to decide what you’re doing rn atleast bc ur doing very widespread use courses too! you have time and you have people dude so just like yk chill and have fun
You A and T level students are lucky that you can cruise the first year ong
I have to lock in both years or fail entirely <This message was edited>
nah pal we had our exams last year 😭
literally me too
I can’t this year, sort of
Cuz of further maths
And I’m already falling behind in physics
Is there no way to swap a subject out or smth?
I can
1st year- do as well as you can while remaining healthy
2nd year- pick what to prioritise
And I’m heavily considering it
Do you _want_ to?
a lot of people drop out of further maths and that’s fine bc literally doing maths alone is an achievement and a half anyways
Do what makes you happy my man
Simple as
Don't do too much at the start and then nothing after fr
Maths is not the issue here tbh
Spread it out and do stuff that you can
I’m doing perfectly fine in maths
We may be overwhelming him a lil guys
No it’s good
Talking about classes you're not doing as well as you want to in- is there any support you can get in them?
I don’t know
But the core issue at the moment is my lack of motivation
Both as I am now
And in general
I'm happy that you're telling us about this
Leo said a similar thing the other day
Its better to get it out than to bottle it up
Yeah
The thing is that I’ve put off sorting this out for years now
If you ever need a day to just sit in silence with someone we're here for you
And it’s become an actual issue now that I’m doing a lot of academic stuff
We’re here, professionals are available, don’t worry about it
I’m worrying about it though
We can help motivate you
Its normal to worry yk
And we are here thru it all
But i cannot stress, make that call king
I don’t know
Talk to them ong
I just feel clueless tbh
I can’t decide
Do you have a student ID number?
Its better to do something than nothing
Not that I know
Alr
I’d say give them a call
It can be as long or short as you want ong
I know, and that’s kinda part of the problem
Yk bro as a fellow a level student, I get it, sometimes its hard to be motivated, I struggle especially when im in my own home, the best thing I cant recommend is to talk to a councillor about it, but also to try and foster some healthy habits, ive been trying recently to foster those habits as well, trying to link free time with revision time, just trying to associate non helpful problems with healthier solutions (free time=revising etc)
Can* not cant
You should do, but I don’t think Ashby put it on the cards. Take a look on arbor if they still use it and it should’ve somewhere on there
Ok
Thanks
I’ll try, hopefully?
I’d be lying if I said it would happen
And thanks for being there for me again guys
Anytime mate, we'll always be here
No problem, that’s what I good friend group is for
All you can do, eventually the positive habits will stick and you'll get the hang of it, but honestly I wouldn't stress too much about it getting this whole further education thing right first try
Some better news: I have convinced my parents to stop pausing the ps5 at night
And I also managed to finish my maths homework
YAYY
Good job man

I had a thunk
And it has become problematic
The processor in my build doesn’t matter too much in 4k
But everywhere else it kinda does
So I looked at am4 alternatives
And I came across the ryzen 9 5950x
An absolute monster
Twice as many cores, double the cache and higher clock rates
But
It costs twice as much as the ryzen 7 5800x on the low end
But I really want a nice processor to pair with my sexy graphics card
I shall have to consult my parents regarding the budget
Cuz if I want to do this then it’ll add like £120 on
And I’m already about £80 over
I hoping they don’t remember what I said the budget was
Did you give an exact figure or a rough rounded figure?
Major order for the bot front boys
Let’s gooooo
Three planets to clear, and hold Hell
Wdym?
For your budget you gave them
Ow anyone?
What
Overwatch
Ja
Not rn tho
Tis self care time
Do a titty mask
I meant more like working out and meditation
Then add a tiddy mask
Meditate with the tiddy mask on
Exactly
I dont have tiddies -_-
Get some
Manifest gurll
That’s what the mask is for
Grow some
What an amazing idea why didn't I think of that
I initially said £800 (£900 including mouse and keyboard), but the build currently costs around £100 more than that
Also it doesn’t matter now <This message was edited>

I’m doing gold if you want to try and join me Dakota
If you haven’t done silver you’ll need to do some extra time
Yeah no I’ve been signed up for bronze with cadets for the last 4 years and still don’t have even a plan so gold is going to be just a little out of my reach
Guys 
We’ve captured the first planet for the major order

We need to work on liberating Valyria 5 for I think potentially a new type of exosuit, or cheopessa iv for a new orbital bomb
That’s so tough
I’ve decided I’d prefer a mech
After carefully rewatching the recordings of past tapes of missions
Death rates to mechs are lower than to orbitals
Idk if it’s a new mech/orbital or if it’s just the free stratagem choice
Because it specifically says emancipator parts
It might be a new type, or just upgraded emancipators
I’m guessing free emancipators
For a short while
I recon it’s a new thing 
Since they’re planning big upgrades for the fight against the bugs
Since if it were something new they would say so outright
As is the purpose of the currentmajor order
They have always told us when we were fighting for something new
Remember AT mines?
True
That is a good point but I’d still prefer a mech to orbitals
As would i
They’ve both been added to the major order and it didn’t say anything about a time limit so I think we are probably allowed both
Imagine if it does end up being a new mech though
We may finally be getting the flamer mech
Or a laser mech
I wouldn’t get my hopes up
Fair
One can hope though
Although we also haven’t had a new free stratagem since the wasp
Which came out in February
And that was absolutely ass
It’s better now but it ain’t good
It was part of the killzone crossover, so their creative liberties aren’t really that much
Labubu shirts spotted in Loughborough
no.

i’ve got a real warhammer shaped itch rn
celestine is calling my
name
but so is belakor…

Fight in his holy light my kindred
Our beneficient emperor calls thee to battle <This message was edited>
He hath ordained your purchase
probs just 50
Yk the celestine aura is too much not to take
true but ALSO idk what i want to do
Also from a beginner standpoint
bc if i pick an army which is hard enough as it is then i have to pick if im gonna do my own computs
colours
its too  much decision making
Celestine is easier to paint than belakor
Smaller surface area
And less spikes
true
I would seriously advise not starting either army with their flagship model
Especially if you don’t know how you want to paint them
She'll also be more interesting to paint than belakor
hmm
As you'll get from new surface to surface easier
im so torn
fair
Meaning you wont get bored easily compare to painting a big model like bel'akor
ya
hmm
i need to ponde r
Ponder then
No rush when it comes to warhammer
We all know you'll come back eventually to spend more money
yeah true
I would advise moving up in size as you develop your painting skills
Maybe try one of the purgator warsuits
Painting whole squads allows you to hone your technique better than one large model
They are drippy
but at same time loke
spending big money
is anxiety inducing
even like £40 quid
in one go atleast
Warhammer is an expensive hobby
i’m perfectly fine spending 70 squids on vinted across like 5 items
No denying that
but one item?? jeez
me ts week btw
Ooh what you bought?
But spending your money on a model that would provide you with more opportunities to build skill and enjoy the army aesthetic would be good
i shall show
What is your design ceylan?

Water has to be outside a ship now doesn't it?
Yes, but it also brings joy
This guys gets it
Life is fun when you realise it doesn't matter
Spit it out man cmon
@Stan
Or swallow it, that works too
shit does matter even if to yourself that’s my thingy
everything good does matter
which also means the bad matters
but the good makes worth
good like the poppy war
good like my unwritten books
good like jojos bizzare adventure

I always realise I’d die within a week, either from disease or some kind of ableism
For konung och fosterland
The song
Lifetime of war
it’s a good song god damn
It is
The Swedish one is better
i have all the slepe token liked,

Its been going downhill and I wanna get it up
fair
The hill I mean
u sure?
Im sure
Im too innocent for that frfr
uh huh
Tee hee
Sure you are
Bullshit
I have a vague idea of what you were saying to Stan when you sat in on the session Ceylan ran
And it does not agree with that statement
The huh what
What was I saying huh
Oh this sounds interesting
I’m not 100% certain
But you mentioned Delilah when I was eating my Nachos
I was actually innocent ong
More specifically when I was eating the cheese
Ohhh
Yeah hehe
That was me my dude
Stab saditit
I was making the dirty joke ong
I think this says more about you Jack than it does her
Yeah that doesn’t sound so innocent
I didn't say it chat
What do you mean
Nothing
That he heard or that it was there to be said about?
Nothing at all
All I did was kiss her ong
Several times
One day ieez
Jeez
She kissed you more accurately
Well yeah but still
promiscuous
I was depressed, her promiscuity was the last of my worries
Go to a fucking therapist you goddamn millennial
No
I’m not a millennial
And im not depressed anymore
Wee
Yo bro how come mine doubled and yours disappeared
Drugs?
I'm not on them
That might be why then
Yo you right
he might be onto smth..
And ima be on something

good morning gang

river my love i need you
do i throw away 18 squids on this
guys my clubbing era is gonna be so good
Yeah do it <This message was edited>
Yeah looks sick
that’s my thoughts too
and she just offered me £15 too so..
gonna have to take it me thinks
Me thinks you’re correct
£20 including shipping tho…
😖
£20 on a bag you're gonna use frequently fr
That's like £1 per use if you use it 20 times
hmm
that’s true
but i’m only gonna use it at the clurb probs
And you're gonna use it more than 20 times
Add it into your daily life fr
It matches the vibe
you’re right..
have it as my handbag when i go out
but like i don’t go out
so that’s a flaw in the plan
Use it to store things in
Its a investment
Function bag?
Or go out more?
I feel like the problem isn’t the bag but rather the lack of occasions where you use a bag
Start making the occasions to use the bag
Ong <This message was edited>
£20 for a good bag is nothing fr
I spent £20 on my yellow crochet bag because I thought it was cute
Now I use it all the time
Although the alternative was stolen
Which didn’t help
Well
I didn't wanna be sad but damn
Sowwy
I only accept apologies in cash
perhaps
cos now my function bag has become my school bag
okay guys ill do it
New bag time
DID IT
heheha
18 in total cos she offered me 14.50 for it
legend
AYYY
You're making money on it now ong

Chat new strategic opportunities
Do go on
Liberate varylia for free mechs, or oasis for free warp packs
Hmm interesting
Only one tho
It’s not a free mech 
It’s a new one 
varylia 5 is the same planet as the last bonus order
And from what i understand the exosuit is likely to be one from the last game
The one with a tank cannon and a flamethrower
I don’t think it’s a new mech
The strategic opportunity specifically says “augment the helldiver arsenal for the liberation of the hive world”
Makes it sound temporary to me
I think we should find ojt
To the bots we go!
But at the same time it says 
‘Grant helldivers additional exosuit’
So it could be a new one
It’s so bloody vague
Unfortunately it’s an annoying planet
It also says additional warp packs, and they can’t just make a variant of that
In *every* new stratagem order, it includes the numerical designation of the stratagem
The exo-49
The mt-17s
Etc
Nowhere to be seen this time
Varylia is a plains planet so has the most annoying angry plants
Plus it’s weather effect is heavy rain which reduces visibility
I can still hope
How often do they repeat a planet for new things if it’s just temp free?
Bc the only repeat I know of is for the tank mines
You make a good point
Wait are there no other repeats?
Chat i just had my first blood test
Did you pass?

Karlia is the remaining planet and it’s a high heat fire tornado planet
I wonder what the dss upgrades will be <This message was edited>
Personally hoping for tunnel boreing hellpods <This message was edited>
So we can call stuff through the caves
Only thing is that only helps a couple of planets
Also they have now fixed being reinforced onto cave roogs
Well the modifiers are to aid in the purging of the hive world <This message was edited>
True <This message was edited>
Also anyone know what’s up with meridia? Suddenly we can visit th black hole again
I think it’s just to remind us why we need to eliminate the terminid threat
Stuff appears to be getting sucked into it tho
Like local debris level
Well it is a black hole/singularity
So why now and not before?
Because now more than ever we need to purge the terminid scum
Also are you going to log on what
My lessons doesn’t finish for another 8 mins, let alone the hour home plus coursework that’s rapidly approaching

And peggle
Man this almost makes me want to go back to that hellhole
This is peak
Man wtf is comp science even about
Good news everyone 
We managed to liberate the last planet with 5 and a half hours left on the clock
Though now the dss is unavailable
Dss is already there, which means no eagle strikes to worry about or blockades to protect hellmire (again)
No DSS aid at all
Not till the upgrades are finished
Do we know how long? I imagine the next MO will be to protect the planet
I give it a couple days to a week
And your probably right
Or it might be another chance to free varylia 5
Also possible it’s a collect resources to aid in the upgrading process
Too bad we can’t call the dss in to orbital blockade the planet
Probably that and hold it
There’s atleast 2 planets that would need to fall before the squids can get to karlia
Other great news
The solo silo one shots factory striders
Ooh nice
I can now safely do that mission type whilst farming super samples
I now need 25
I have 2
Yeah that’s only like 5 ish missions
Hold up does an autocannon do pretty much the same thing damage as a quasar?
Because if so then we could just chuck an autocannon sentry down to act as a portable SAM site against bot drops
I’m stuck on dif 6 
At most I get 3 supers
It doesn’t
Rocket sentry may work though
Nice
Anyone want to join me
Can’t, gotta work
Where do you work
At home, for college
Ohh found out what happened yesterday to the road into Coalville
Water pipe burst

Fr
Like watching the land be torn up and concreted over
Nah because what in the helly do we do after
Ive been watching that land everyday for six years
Is bro turning into the new greta thunburg
Its the same for here near ellistown
Always was
Unbsnsjsbsbsbsbbssbbs
English good
Beautiful corporate expansion
Kys
Took the words out of my mouth ong
This was also perfectly good regeneration land
Amend now its overpriced fucking housing
Hmo
Mass genocide
Less people = less housing
Maybe not
But instead of large overpriced detached housing
Cannibalism, also solves hunger
How about a decent flat block?
Why does bro make a good point
Instead of either this expansionism and the concrete blocs
He does
Megabuildings
YES
BUT GOOD ONES
Statistics speaking a human only needs 20 square feet to be alive
Not the kind in sheffield
We can half that and get away with it
Ill kms
Id be so cozy in 30ft squared
20*
I need to frolick when im bored
Ahh but see megabuildings surrounded by forest regeneration
Throw in a costa and a turkish barber on the bottom floor and we have a government contract
But would a couple get 40ft or just 30 bc they sharing?
15
Give or take
Ser stan is joking
But im deadass
I wanna keep my garden
Nah i’m deadass
Balcony
About the initial idea
Public allotments managed by the megabuilding surrounding it
Where tf am I meant to grow potatoes
And onions and tomatoes and strawberries and carrots
Leaving my corpotocracy out of it
Meaning no fuckass unions to gatekeep allotments
And broccoli and lettuce
.
This bro
What else do we put on the roof?
Everyone should whimsy out
BANGING
Insulation and free space
Babe we are moving to the woods
But these need to be charity managed
Solar panels?
Not gov not private
No
Ooh tricky
It wasn't a question
No
I might actually design ts
I must have my cyberpunk dreams
I like how you think you have an opinion on it
Ahh see
Solarpunk
Best of both our visions
This will be rhe next generation of affordable counsel housing
Perhaps rainwater collected to use for hydroelectric power, and then used as normal water for drinking, watering plants and what ever else
And it wont be shit
You've heard of a gravity battery yes?
Thinking hydroelectric gravity battery
Exactly
From the roof, turbines on the way down, stored underneath for use
Gravity batteries have to rise
So centre of building imo
The water cycle does at least part of the rising for us <This message was edited>
Then perhaps pay residents to manually move water do extra energy?
Not as a full job, but a side hustle for a couple extra quid <This message was edited>
Hm maybe
I think paying them to manage the building they live in sounds good to me
Cuz the government will own this
I aint selling it to no corp
So the building will need, A. Sustainable power generation for around let's call it 3000 people
Jobs that pay more than staying there
For around 3000 people
And a forest regeneration area surrounding it
With public gardens on the roof
Solar panels on the side?
Not as efficient but still
Is it going to be purely a place to live, or perhaps shops or similar on ground floors for extra jobs?
Yes I like that
And proper security
To reduce the chance of organised crime entering
Well also need to account for the most common jobs the average person has
Not letting them police themselves?
Common law and all thay
I meant physically as well as through residents
Ah true
Like proper barriers with perhaps a resident key?
On the outermost doors, but a free open common area central to the building
Yes
Open to visitors as well as residents
Perhaps we could offer education as well as jobs
For all ages
So those we employ to build it, can perhaps learn new qualifications relative to the building allowing them to intergrade to the building
Free ofc
Formal education or life skills?
Maybe a mix of both
Depending on the person
So hold on
3000×20ft=60000sqft
Thats how much floor space we'd need
That’s just the housing space tho, no common areas or anything else not even corridors
Yeah
Ik i was just setting a standard for rooms
So let's say
6 floors for housing
Bottom floor for retail/common area
Middle floor should be education and something else
Top floor should be recreation
9 floors
Exercise, educational (bettering self) or recreational?
Wdym
I’m assuming you’ll want to put a gym somewhere rather than relying on the cardio of all those stairs
Yes
Elevators defo
Space considering as well
Powered directly through the gravity battery?
Gp surgery too
Could do
That house
Has the same floor space as one of these housing floors
We haven’t considered yet, underground and the benefits as opposed to going up
I dont want to shove the poor underground
But underground does propose benefits for things like shopping
That can go underground
Geothermal heating
Also we are talking 9 floors
Its kpt.that big ngl
We can do a mix
No sadly people need sunlight
And i hope to give every room some access to sunlight
Rock and stone?
Basement parking
Though we’ll try to keep pedestrians safe
Minimise road usage
Unlikely to have car access
The point of this is that people will not need to leave
Depends on proximity to other buildings
But they may want too
Holidays employment etc
Public transport
Employment is provided by the building
Basement rail hub then
YES
Not for all 3000 surely
Police officers? Airline pilots? Larger office space?
For at least half of the people
Assuming people will stay put is a lil foolish
Humans like to roam
This is a building for those current in unemployment and acclaiment
It could become the national standard tho
Can’t forget a parole office then
Ik thats why we are hoping to provide a very large area to roam outside the building
Those with higher paying jobs will likely think themselves to good for this
We just need to say that this is the best option to reduce immigration
Zack boom
No that'll cause outrage
What about once they have jobs? Are they free to stay or will they be moved out to create space for others?
Furthermore with the population and housing crisis
Alongside the growing wage gap
Yes they can stay
It may become the standard wether people like it or not
Oki so I just had a test what’d I miss
The building only provides enough jobs for half the resident population
Maybe more
Yes but even people with jobs are struggling to sustain themselves
But we also provide education benefits
This building hopes to fix that
By becoming the he standard?
Because this is what people could afford
We’re making much better council housing by making megabuildings
Solarpunk shi
Keep the bottom 3 residential floors for married and family housing
Minimising travel distance for yound children
Good idea
Education is on the floor above and retail is below
But recreation is on top...
Solo housing on upper floors
See id say inverse
Family on top
And solo on bottom
Cuz then children have proximity to both education and recreation
Solos have access to both retail and education as well
Ahh but children don’t like noisy or long travel
Elevators or stairs will do that
Solos are more willing to walk long distances
Children like recreation tho
And sunlight
And by taking families out of the mix early it minimises elevator congestion
Hmmm
Well discuss floor arrangements later
Now let's lust the absolut necessities this needs
What about garbage disposal
List*
Underground floor mate
Chute if you will
Food production?
Importation sadly
Garden/allotments
So a necessity for cargo elevators
We live in the uk we already cant provide enough food
Not enough space
Hmm only to the retail floor
Which is on the bottom
Education and recreation may need food and equipment too
Not to mention maintenance
Hmm
All floors need spare parts
So a set of 4 cargo rated elevators and 16 smaller people elevators?
Sounds good
Banging
Anything else?
Humans nedd
Sewerage
Thats not really a problem is it?
We're not the burj khalifa
Plumbing?
Disposal?
We just do it?
Like this is a non problem imo
Standardise furniture for rooms or allow personal furnishings?
To start standardised
But we'll allow residents to sell there furniture to the firm(us) that owns it
That allows us to speed up the furnishings of new MB
Not sell but donate
@River can you think of anything we are missing?
Bitches
Balconies?
Compost?
im tryna apply to college mb cuh
Ah sorry mb
Yes
100%
Well have a natural food waste chute and regular waste chute
What’s the stance on pets?
Hmmm
Don't know yet
What the problem pet really?
Dogs/cats
The others cant really cause damage
To my knowledge
Cats tend to be mostly self sufficient, so dogs if any but any will need a vet service of some kind <This message was edited>
Luckily for them dogs will have more than enough space to roam
Also paving the way for way for livestock
Given the large area around the MB we intend to regenerate
Also this needs to be colourful
I aint having a repeat of sheffield
Hmm idk about that one
Chat we might be sitting on a great idea
Cuz this has been done before in Hungary and it worked there
Hears something we didnt think of
Religion
Do we provide it
Or do we provide bus service out to local transport hubs
Like of we're to build this it has to be somewhere like b'ham or Manchester
Not in it but near it
Multi faith room, then residents can organise from there
Ooh no
Bad bad idea
It’s likely to be a set of buildings near each other despite attempts for roaming green space so busses will likely make a route through
Just one road out of the plaza bus comes every half hour
Allows for imports and public transport
Cannot allow car transport tho
If we do
It will ruin the whole idea
Cars take up monstrous amounts of space and road congestion out of this building will be horrible
Allow those living in cars to sell them to us an use the parts for th building?
Hmm yes I like that
Or we can have a local car garage
Not in the complex but along its bus route
And the bus will be free to resident with a key
Allowing a resident to park in the garage anf simply hop on one of the half hour buses
Chat we gotta crack open blender at some point and design this
What kind of key? Being aware of thefts
Key card
Unique facial id
Boom no random people just waltzing onto a bus
But to stop room theft
Unique fingerprint id
Last night my mum flat faced went "oh my God did yk halloween is on Friday 13th this month"
That’s gonna be expensive technology to get working consistently
-_-
This year even*
She's been on Facebook chat
Its a card with your face on it
They got her for a moment
Its like college lanyards
They cost 2.50
Oh I thought you meant a facial scanner on the bus
No
Thats crazy
College lanyard backed up by room unique fingerprint
Suddenly alot of effort to rob someone who's already in counsel housing in a guarded building
Will there be an office or anything to get replacements?
Best part is we cant track them so no privacy is violated
Yes bottom floor
Outside of the gates
Like college
Or actually
You can just wring the reception get them to verify who you are and they let you in to get a replacement
Ring a bell?
Not a bell
More like an intercom
Biometrics?
Why not finger print registration?
Using that for rooms
Tryna get on a bus with a severed finger and will create questions
Ooh yes for the front door is much easier
Mb
So yeah card is simply for bus service
Kinda like an autism pass but just for the plaza bus
Just flash it to bus driver and get in
Or finger scan the bus ong
Its cheap enough nowadays
Hmm maybe
If ibby can afford it the firm definitely can
Your right
Right my bus has arrived ill be back
Chat I can actually plan ts using dungeon scrawl 😭
Cuz it uses 5ft squares
Oh thatll be massive
Yes but It allows me to visualise this
And to plan rooms better
K so stan
I just realised how small 20sqft is
You fucking idiot
Yeah we’d be going Japanese apartment with it
Yeah so no maybe not
Maybe let's do 40sqm
As thats uk average for a studio apartment
I said survive
Not be comfortable
Thats your fault
Fuckass bitch
Anyhow 🫩
We know looking at 120000 sq meters
For all residents
Thats closer
Wdym
Closer to a real megabuilding
20000 sq meters per floor
Yeah im not good at visualising size
But this seems alright
Yeah 9 floors was always going to be generously small
We can still do this yk?
Yeah absolutely, just scaled up a bit
Thats fine ngl
Guess im doing sustainable architecture at some point
Stan do I see a stoþard Inc. Coming along? Catering for people since 1978?
Also chat where is everyone at?
In the box office
Was just there 🫩

I’ve now seen the stealth suit kill team
I need it
I might just not get the codex yet
And try for both boxes for Christmas
Farsight will unfortunately have to wait
Interestingly the pathfinder killteam isn’t on warhammer’s website anymore
Chat im watching a show on Netflix that was originally written in Norwegian and its so trippy and funny how it feels like one of those 2010 teen dramas 😭😭😭
Wanna hear a bad joke? <This message was edited>
But is simultaneously a modern reimagining of Ragnarök
What
The theme for mortal kombat was first sung in a norse church
It was a finnish hymn
I will kill you
Mhmm
Swedish folk, always willing to defend Sweden to the last finn
Gott mit uns
We got mittens too
I thought it said “their British invaders”
Chat help
I can’t sleep
And I’ve just been doing dnd tomfuckery for like 2 and a half hours
I was making an actually cool character
And the thematic build
Is literally the most broken character I’ve ever made
(In combat)
(They’re also quite good outside of it)
hell yeah
Oh god what have you based this one off
Got unfortunate news 
I’m being made to grown up as my parents are going out
bro what
grown up?🫩
We move the party to your house?
No because my gremlin is still here

Glad

ZIGGGY
Chat why must this Ragnarök show must be so peak 😭😭😭😭
i’m gonna predict 4 days and this wil be finished
Holy mother of supposed peak
Let us know how it goes
shall do
also who was gonna tell me drukhari are insanely cool
We did
But there also freaky sex elves
So...
i support women’s rights and women’s wrongs
But drukhari are both sexes?
We did mention the freaky sex elves
Could've sworn we did
They also torture people for sexual pleasure
Yeah
There genuinely horrible people
Look into there first contact with Tau
Not to mention the surgical horrors
Interesting
Its more dakotas thing
And the sacrifice of regular elf souls to an ancient sex goddess
Who devours there souls for all eternity
To save their own
The ancient sex god they created by fucking too hard as a species
oh ok..
Ja
We did tell you about them
tyranids are also cool
That is true
Nidz are cool
Genesneakers less so
But orks is best
nuh uh
anywys
i’m SO torn with what i wanna get
why on earth is it so hard
How so?
Get them all?
cos you have to pick which army you want then you have to pick which colours and it’s too much decision making
like there’s so many cool armies
Colour randomiser?
You dont have to really unless you intend to play the game
*KILL TEAM*
Small range
i still have to pick
hmm…
Ahh thematic I get ya
Might I recommend sticking with imperial then
As it gives you a wide range but still allows variety
But granted small female variety
idk tho
imperial is like
they’re cool cos they have aura but they’re all just people
idk i’m so toen
Hmmm
Can I recommend buying tau maybe?
There typically fun models to build paint and display
Plus the colour choice is much more varied
As no one will really get on your dick for painting them different
Unlike imperial
in they’re a little too sci fi for me me
thinks
Sigmar then?
lord help me drukhari are calling to me so much
Then buy them
Have fun with the kinky space elves ig
Chat i hate this fuckass show
?
Season 2 they've changed most of the English VA's cause they all have too thick of a Norwegian accent
No ones forcing you to watch it cuh
ty bro

Just finished the senior maths challenge
It was fucking HARD
Holy shit
They gave us an hour and a half to answer 25 multiple choice questions
And they explicitly stated *in the regulations* that we are not expected to answer all of them
I finished around half of them
Well done
I am hoping for a silver at best
Based on last years grade boundaries
Chat spotify cooks, giving me carolus rex while im doing an assignment about denmark
Yes
Conquer denmark
Bleeding danes
Different question

Sustainable transport in a given city, I was given Copenhagen

But its so easy to ragebait ceylan
Or ill beat you up

🤺
What debate about minorities?
I just mentioned percentages
Making me sound racist smh
Mhm
I got stung by a wasp in my jaw and I flicked it away and made some fuckass noise that sounded like bella swan
Damn

HUH

I’m not a nazi guys
So bring them over

Or invite us to the house parties ong
That too
not sure i can do that gang
i don’t have that kind of authority
Mannnn
im close with like 5 people there, aquainted with like 6, and like 10 i dont know
Host the party, then you can decide who comes and who doesnt
Just tryna go to a house party, not drink, not talk to anyone and then leave
oh but also my childhood best friend will be there so we got hella catching up to do
oh ok
that’s what i usually do
Host one then choom
Damn so we don't even get told about them
i’ve hosted like 1 since march😭😭
i’m on cooldown since my birthday
had like 20 people over i can’t be doing that shit again
Ability cooldown
ok so that's not usually then
Gotta wait a year for the cooldown to finish for next birthday
yeah exactly
or maybe easter half term
probably the soonest i’ll be allowed tbf
Damn
Tight crash
No parties for me ig
it’s the cost of having a friend group who are just one huge cluster
And theres no subgroups?
Where am i gonna see drunk people make a fool of themselves ???
The internet
yes but they’re ashby goers and i am not an ashby goer
So get some Loughborough goers involved
idk choom
I’ll bring the blackshirts as backup
not sure they’re gonna appreciate me inviting a 16 year old 🫩
Yeah but like so are jack and Oscar
*12 sixteen year olds
bring will, then he has to "look after" his younger brother
I don’t think they can do that choom
Chat this is depressing
Indeed
And the fact that I just almost misspelled chat
How?
cath
Someone miss spelled the name Ed yesterday
Laptop spellcheck is not peak, and it doesn't autocapitalise either
might get him tattooed guys
i can just emote with it
Maybe don’t
you’re such a contrarian
You’ll have to explain who he is to everyone who is a decade younger than you
And why that is funny
Yeah i am
they don’t mind
i already plan on making the children in on my hobbies
i want to host a dnd for the primary school kids
i watched a video on how it’s actually super good for developing confidence creativity and maths skills in children
so it’s teaching and also fun
that would be so funny to wathc
but also great though
and it teaches maths
yur
We’re massive goobers and we could be considered “young adults”
problem solving and critical thinking too
i AM a young adult
and acting
Job
YURPPP
Die?
:3
I’ll watch the bloopers ong
if you do it, we need to get it filmed for like a recruitment ad or something

production team
I thought you hated kids anyway?

i work with kids btw and going to uni to work with kids htw
ok so we need will and all his mates to get working on the trailer
What the hell happened here
teenagers want to be popular and get drunk together
Ahh got it
Real ngl
But everyone lives to far away
apparently ashyb is the place to be
@Jack Payne @Oscar Hunt Brown can you confirm?
Mhm
Sure thing pal
i think my friends are just a certain type of person is all
they’re very outgoing and sociable
you say that like they weren't watching AOT for a lesson
Mine are too but have too strict parents to host parties
Yeah?
I’m not sure on the context
house parties
Ashby?
ashby have hella house partied
atleast year 13 does
Idk
According to Ceylans mates
tom was telling me they’re all white rich kids with massive bojses
houses
I don’t know anyone who lives in ashby

And so it begins
Chart I have started playing god of war
Ts is peak
Annoying that it’s almost as old as my brother
But still a masterpiece
I tell a lie
It was not released in 2016
It was released in 2019
Making it 6 years old rather than 9
bro.
Spoilers ik
Mb bro
I’m fucking dying
I just watched an aldi ad
And the fucking guy
He fucking described the lettuce as “hella fresh” and I *fucking* quote
I’m gonna commit various nefarious acts
Whæt
he’s right tho
also burning god is significantly worse than poppy war and dragon republic
Damn that must be some good lettuce
Shame hope it gets better
What have we said about fucking your food
i had an insane lettuce phase
would just buy a bag and eat it straight
A bag? Just buy a head
i like the bags better
pre chopped
crunchier
asda ones atleast
You should ask Will Jerram about his lettuce phase, when he slept over mine multiple times he literally snuck downstairs to bite chunks out of a head of lettuce
i’ll have to enquire tomorrow
He works Saturdays
he’s at the party i believe afterwards
Chat why do i gotta be awake 🫩
I wanna eep all day
Me too, but unfortunately the grind demands daily logins
Assignment today 😭
Two today, plus two Monday, plus corporal boards Thursday in the army building
Damn
bro has to be awake at 9 and is complaining🫩
I’m not complaining about being up at 9
I’m complaining about being up at all
my fuckass ziggy woke me up before i had to be up and i was FUMINGGG
I’m excited for dnd and i don’t wanna do shit today
fair enougj
Our ziggy
i’m excited for dnd and also to get drunk and that’s literally the only thing keeping me going
Alcoholism?
dndholic?
And what
God forbid a guy like to play imaginary characters
Roleplay
Smh 🫩
Pipe down dakota
I see you
When are you playing the act of 'father' then
One is a way of escaping reality, the other is a better way of escaping reality
Nuh uh
What 🫩
You wish
Nah he’s only the Master for cyberpunk
Indeed
He's a master of smth
Sleeping
Bating
Nah never liked fishing
hello what
Rage baiting
I’m just as lost as you 🫩
I’m eating a wholeass galaxy like a fat bastard
just brawl already guys
Nah
Violence is never the answer
Share
Hmm
No
I'll lick it so he can't have any dw
She just stole the rest 😭
I lickedit
Hehe
What makes you think that stops any of us
Mkay bro
Freak
Chill yo beans
Good chocolate is good chocolate
bro what is THIS
There is no debate
My last piece of chocolate
And you still ate that last piece...
Since been eaten
Fatass
i support women’s rights and women’s wrongs
I don’t
Guys can’t wait for the 29th, I finally get to hav equal rights
You can throw hand
The appointments like 5 hours
Les go
Confucius say: it is good to meet girl in park, but better to park meat in girl- i hate reddit chat
Tis better to cum in the sink, than to sink in the cum
Slags
Wait should I wear it on the remembrance parade?
Does it count as a glove?
Wear a goth dress
Because then it would have to be parade spec
I have to reread all the ACPs for my board Thursday anyway, so I’ll take a look if they do prosthetics differently
But we’ve had enough issues with them and disability discrimination that they’re probably too scared to say anything as long as it’s mostly under control
Yeah you can always call a discrimination tribunal if its a problem
They tried to say I physically couldn’t fly or shoot bc of it, even tho I’d done both before outside
Well shooting would only be a problem because of it being your right hand
As far as rifles and archery goes, somehow I’m ambidextrous
The rifles aren’t tho
The l98 can only be shot right handed
The british army doctrine for lefties is “lol knock that shit off now”
Nah we were on the BSA scorpion whe I did my WHT
Yeah you can shoot that
But the real bug guns don’t play nice with lefties
There’s always duct tape
Fair
i think you mean a left and right
Okay broseph
you know i’m right
Nah i thought you were left
Not very punk of you otherwise
sybau
Mhmm
Why be right or left when you can rise above?
cannot rise above in a system where people suffer😛
a bystander stands with the oppressor 🙏
Suffering is in the mind, the only power over yo they have is the power to let them have
We live in a corpotocracy
Just get rich and rise above
say that to the bombed babies🥺
oh yea
On my way!
I would, but they don’t hear so good anymore
Thats a different society which doesn’t use our political system
??
Comparing our system to theirs doesn’t really work
our system allows them to thrive btw
we give weapons btw
fund them btw
😳😳
They fund us
We give them weapons
Its just good business
yk what
i can’t tell if you’re being serious
or if i’m being rage baited
I’m mostly rage baiting you
I’m entirely rage baiting, but knowing that won’t stop you raging
okay good cos otherwise i think i may go a little crazy at you
But using a foreign country’s politics in a discussion of out own systems seems irrelevant
guys why do you insist on rage baiting me
we just clarified how are systems r interlinked
At the end of the day our argument was on political alignments and not the actions of our actual government
okay and
conversations flow and progress my dude
But an argument has a focus?
Not me, I don’t have focus
wasn’t an argument or devate just a discussion
no topic
just discussion my dude
Cool
woah
this school shooting ain’t shit
I’ll have you know i was ready to return fire
fire?
rin mentioned
Dead?
what the fuck is not being racist
What
what the fuck is not being a genocidal murderer
oh ok
I’m confused
oh

rin uses fire abilities
Mkayy

guys i gain warhammer models tomorrow
this is so exciting
i can’t decide on fucking colours brooo
i know i want to change their hair from that fuckass orange
Just paint your models choom

how am i supposed to CHOOSE
this is an autistic persons worst nightmare
You just DO
Look at some colours and think “yeah i’ll paint that”
literally not that easy
Witewally is
witewally it’s not
i care about aesthetics alot
and if i chose wrong…
Random colour picker?
What colours do you like?
i lik
black green pink blue
but then i have to pick shades and also placement
Well think of a solid base colour
Then highlight details
probably black
But remember, minimise the amount of colour on a single item
yeah..😖
Spread colours across seperate elements, it’ll make it less messy
Less is more
hmm
let’s consult over call boyo
tonight after my dads
be there or be swuare
Alr bet
I have some things in the works so a good brainstorm would be well placed
What if

Chat
Nah
reduced to stans wife😭😭😭
Ive known bro for YEARS
He just really likes stan
kill him
He treats him like a god
kill the side hoe.
Not in a romantic way
In a
Stans side ho
Haha you're tall I love you
Kinda way
in a worship way
He's autistic I can't explain him
biblical love
Fr
You don’t need to
😭😭
We’re all 99% sure
AHAT
Nah
Stans asleep
He can't stop my freak
wake up stan
😼
Damn can’t even summon him to play ow
Nah he's an eepy guy
where’s our 0-10 widow maker when we need him
just had another benefits accusation slung at me by my dad
Ha
i’m not on fucking benefits😭😭
he’s convinced we’re secretly minted because of them
we are not minted nor on benefits
feels a little contradictory father
Get on benefits then?
literally don’t need them
But extra money?
It isn't that easy my guy
You might get it a little easier tho.
Exavtlyyyyyyy
Who needs both hands, you’ve got a spare
I have to sleep downstairs because I keep getting attacked by wasps every morning
oh
also literally why would i try and get benefits and take money from funds for people who actually need it
Like me 😛😛
That’s a real mentality among those who do need it, and it’s wrong bc your it taking it away, it gets seen as unused and not needed, so gets scrapped from those that do use it. If you take the benefits it builds the support to get more people help bc it shows the government it’s needed
He got a point
Therefore, get the whole squad on benefits
Fwog
I want the frog
but i DONT need it😭
But you could be allowed it
doesn’t make it right
also i wouldn’t
we make enough to not need benefits legally and day to day
couldn’t *
How do you know? There’s ones for being unemployed, which you keep complaint abojr
i’m in full type education cyh
cuh
under my parents roof too
Oh well
Im 4 years old
WOAH, YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST PERSON EVER
Fairy
Wjat the fuck is going on here
A lot, and at the same time absolutely nothing
Chat have any of you seen the news about gaza recently? Not to start the day politically but, just to make sure im not going crazy
No? What’s happened?
Ceasefire, Israeli troops have pulled back to about halfway in gaza, and over 200k Palestinians have returned
If this goes well, we could see the removal of Israeli troops from gaza and a somewhat sort of peace
Tho the plan has many holes
It says nothing about stopping airstrikes, it doesnt say what will happen if hostage return is delayed on the hamas side, and we have no clue as to how they are going to demillitarise the area in a way that doesn't cause conflict
But this is definitely good steps
But U.S troops have been deployed to Israel to oversee, and troops from turkey Egypt and the UAE will also be joining if the removal of troops goes well
If this does go well, gaza will have a buffer zone like how Cyprus has one
To celebrate, let there be dogs
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdWJHR8s/
Yippee
But yes, this is progress but many obstacles remain
And Israel is still very openly war hungry
And genocidal
But people are going home
Lands are being withdrawn from
And sadly so far this plan by trump appears to be working 🫩
Lets only hope he can succeed further for once
We’re getting our theme park RAHH
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The plan hopes to "at some point" return the land to Palestinian control
*after we build our theme park
Til then it will be ran by tony blair (no joke) a revolving council of Palestinian technocrats and U.S officials
Oh god
TWO THEME PARKS
Alongside supervision from the aforementioned countries
AMERICA FUCK YEAH
Yes them
And other regional nations who are less pro Israel
THIS WON’T BE LIKE THE RHINELAND AT ALL RAHHH
Itll hopefully be more like Cyprus
And not lebanon
Or bosnia
Tho the latter is still likely
Or afghanistan
Or iraq
Or korea
Or vietnam
They dont have bufferzones to prevent conflict
Nvm
Actually they all did at some point
They just didn’t last very long
But it did keep some peace yes?
Depends if that peace makes up for the following decade of war
But potato potato
What
The fuck are you talking about
Oh got ya
They actually are not involved
Fucking crazy right?
The UN still isn’t doing anything
Which means warcrimes are BACK on the table
It is literally useless
Yesnt
The demands for both sides are simple
Release all* current hostages
Bith Israeli anf Palestinian
Except for one Palestinian
He's not being released due to apparently his five murder charges, but likely because hes a candidate to lead the Palestinian state
This sounds like a shaky agreement at best
It is
Israel has promised to continue if they domt grt there 48
And the use of the US as a mediator instead of the UN is also concerning <This message was edited>
Sorry what
Oh nvm
It is
But its all we got sadly
Something is better than nothing
Lets just hope everyone plays their part and the fat orange man doesn’t have any port
Yep
Problem is hamas has said its not sure if it can retrieve all the corpses
Which is a problem
Yeah
Israel wants all the bodies
And hamas isnt sure if it cam retrieve them all
Lot of rubble to move then
Yeah its bad
Bbc is finally showing footage of the area
And holy shit
There is literally nothing
I can't evem compare it to a piece of fiction
By the way what time does the new bus to Coalville go that way from ibstock?
12 past
Yeah shelling will do that to ya
Alr sick
There’s a new bus?
Oh wait you mean lc6?
Or 15
Yah
Lc6
Ah then no clue
Coalville to hinckley
Ah alright
Worth a try
Why do you ask?
Other slight problem
The noble peace prize was awarded yesterday
Amd trump did not win
So his will to continue is shaky
In my opinion
Brother hasn’t got peace yet?
Once the deal goes through he can get nominated but greta thunburg is in an isreali prison by choice rn

Its also sells gravy
Dont make it a gravy shop
You could call it that
Kebab was just the item of relevance

Could call you a fuvking mong mate

Dw, Coalville is already enough of a nuclear wasteland I might grow my fingers back
The radon gas be crazy
Can’t wait to trade 64 ringpulls for an improvised machine gun at the settlement they build in the quarry
Fallout style

Big fucking news
Satisfactory has had its release date announced on PlayStation
Glorious day
It will release on the 4th of November
Time to start saving
Is that on Xbox too?

Automation time
Indeed it is
Gunpowder treason and plot
Skål!
Though I don’t think it’ll be releasing for ps4
Only ps5
Fuck yeah is it gonna be crossplay
HELL YEAH
Wait
I misread
We aren’t sure yet then
Between console at launch
I hope so
Wdym
Pc to console some time later
Fuck yeah
So Xbox to ps5?
Indeed
So Xbox to PlayStation at launch, and pc can join later
Yeah they can’t do pc yet due to technical limitations
Different build I assume
I would agree
Forget deep rock, and helldivers can take a backseat, its factory time
Same publisher as drg
Diggy diggy hole, let’s exploit nature
Unfortunately the game is capped at 4 players
Which may become an issue?
Hmm not really
You’re probably right
Is it the same 4 or can we sub people out depending who can play?
What?
As in
The same 4 accounts
What?
Or 5 people but only 4 at once
4 at once
6 people, 4 can play at any given time
update guys
Lets hear it
Makes sense
project hail mary is good so far but there’s sooooo much physics at a postgraduate level that my head hurts
this book i think
Ooh
It might be for physics people?
I’m interested now <This message was edited>
Learn them then
is intended for scientists to understand it comprehensively
like it’s good for accommodation for normal people i suppose
but i’ve had to google things a few times and i’m 60 pages in
What is indepth about it?
when there’s a lot of jargon in a paragraph i lowkey skim over it
Ceylan your wife wants you, go check insta
i shall look
it slime
it’s like
they’ve discovered light absorbing potential life forms near venus
petrova line lalalal
jargon jargon
Ohh photsynthetic organisms
no
I heard about that a while ago
not water  or carbon based life
Uhh
If its light absorbing
it’s fiction guys i don’t know if ts is something that can actually occur
Its photosynthetic
dude literally you don’t need to explain ts to me idc
the book will explain
Cuz there’s a specific chemical that we’ve only seen living things make
Aight
Mansplainingggggg
Not really?
he’s discovered light absorbing particles that is dimming the sun and he’s still tryna figure out why and what’s happening cos he can’t remember shit after waking up from stasis

No quite literally
No the episode where rick’s baby mama is a planet
OHHH
unity
ZEEEUUUSSSSS
i love her
No
Not quite to my knowledge
No, that’s another one
Gaia
Unity is a hive mind
They look like gingerbread peple
The episode where he fucks the planet not a planet’s worth of people <This message was edited>
ohhh
like
the one where jerry becomes a cave man god
Yes
Yeah the first time
And summer inhales brake fluid while morty attempts to drive
she’s real for that btw
i can’t believe i’m at a point in my life where i’m older than summer
i was younger than morty when i first watched
Oh yeah
and now i’m older than summer
it’s insane
she’ll always seem older to me me thinks
Just wait till your as old as Beth
dude i was year 6 when i first watched😭😭😭
don’t…
Damn thats just rude
At least you’ll never be Jerry
Its when you’re as old as rick you need to end it
exactly
Unc status
Science unc
Bill nye the science guy
But he has a soul orgasm with a dragon
he’s also real for that😝
Is he?
yea
Yeah id say so
if i had a dragon i’d soul bond with it
Its not sex and its cool
omfg dnd concept idea
He drafts his granddaughter and grandson into a soul orgy with the same dragon <This message was edited>
New barbarian subclass ngl
uhhh
this part isn’t so real
What
i won’t lie morty did it first
Literally didn’t
yeah he bonded with a dragon first right ?
he asked rick for one
He bonded contractually
Not a real soul bond
yeah
ah
Less orgasmic
Apparently
No orgasm for bro
The slut dragon lore is crazy
apparently
bro dragons are so cool im doubling down on ts shit
Rick also buys Morty a sex robot in an earlier episode
Kinda a bad influence
What am i doing with my life rn 🫩
making sure he has sex safe is what i’m seeing
Literally has a child with that robot
there’s always bumps in the road
Yeah but the bump isn’t meant to catapult you into a ditch
I mean a bump on the road could ?
What the fuck have I arrived to
Not a clue
Rick and morty debate
I see
The child tries to kill him
I gambled today
And I fucking won
LETD FUCKINGNGOOOOOL

@Stan, we’ve had the police visit us at cadets and I asked them for advice for you, they said maybe look at going with th sniffer dogs or the sperm dogs apparently?
I’m looking at that or armed policing
guess who’s applying for uni ts weekend
Hmm
Idk…
i’m lowkey in a rush to cos my friend already got an offer
Yippee congratulations
so i need to catch up
_dropout_
oh
I’m joking ofc
did u guys hear that
Lock in choom
We did
dropping out and staying look both so good and call appetising so i’m just gonna pick the easier option of doing nothing
Youll be right tho, youve got a year and a half til you go more or less
both*
yurp
Have you considered… going out and socialising once you get there?
Real ngl, A levels is killing me but a D is better than literally nothing
exactly
uhhh
once i get where
Uni
Uni i think,
Make friends dumbass
damn
well obviously
i’m literally going sheffield for their nightlife cmon
and the music scene too but yea
The world renowned sheffield nightlife
yurp
You say that but then you’re gonna say you cba to go to anything
Already??? I ain’t even started my ps yet
true
hurry heo

thank you thomas rippin we say in unison
Praise the lord

had to delete a whole ahh paragraph
Dakota… could you brung your missus to the Halloween party? (River is desperate to see her and I don’t want jack dnd to skin me)
Well you do gotta justify it
thank you stan for reiterating it man
Could river not come to the session?
No
Jack and ben can only tolerate one visitor at a time
he said he’d be okay with it as long as he knows in advance
ah right
Also i feel like the function would be a better social occasion since your missus is supposed to be playing aswell
Frayed knot, she lives two and a half hours away and her parents don’t like driving so I only get to see her every couple months
Dayum
Unless we make the party on the Friday night, as she is staying local overnight
You what
This friday coming?
Yeah, the day before dnd
Youre out aremt you stan?
Will be tough since i’m on holiday this week
I’m planning for there to be at least some pictures of her with us at the session, an river could always swing by to like walk home with yoy
On an unrelated note, new sabaton album 😝😝 amd holy fuck
Plus we’ll have at least an hour after the session before she has to leave
Ooh nice
I’ll see what i can do
Coolio
In other news, I’ve just had a meeting with Loughborough about safety concerns over soldering and etching
Oh yay
Why?
yipee
Wait nvm
Stoopid
I’ve done that shit one handed before idk what theyre afraid of
They went into researching new things they could get to make it easier, so I showed up and did it with the base kit bc newbridge had us doing it year 7
They were looking at like self feeding machines, but it’s a one handed bit of kit anyway
Bout to say
You only really need one hand to guide whatever your using yeah?
Pretty much
And then just for fun I swapped hands and carried on <This message was edited>
Styling on them with a soldering iron is crazy work
Good show them you are no different
No I am different, I’m better
Thats the mindset
Unlike all our fleshy prisons, he carries natural capacity for improvement
A true servant of the omnissiah
Flesh is weak
Machine is strong
Although that is the legally preferred treatment from an organisation, as there could have been issues that needed stuff, as opposed to being left behind
Praise his holy scriptures
Cracking out the holy prayers of the omnissiah while doing pc upgrades always helps
(As I’m about to walk into my coding lesson)
No its fuvking scary
It helped
We didn’t have the incense but the crystals helped ionise his holy rays of binary
I’m a trained tech priest
I know what i’m doing

i won’t say i told you so but i just know that i did
Have you seen him in his 20s????
yeah his emo ahhh
Sometimes this show looks so scrumptious
I KNOWWW
such an edible art style
I could absolutely take a bite of that hextech singularity
i been saying tsss
you guys said i was a lunatic
YES
Lunacy is the first step on the path to glorious evolution
Viktor ahhh sentence
the glorious ovulation
Shut up about your glorious ovulation 😭
why he lowkey look like lw here
never
Cus hes shirtless cuh
ur right
Its the pink
also i got the bp on ow so im like 50 tiers from getting lw
Yippee
The only good part of the show
uhhhh
Idk the fascism was pretty cool
Not the fascism, but somehow I forgot about the hot lesbians
They are better than the glorious ovulation
Somehow the same arc.
not sure how two brilliantly written women have been reduced to hot lesbians
ohhhh
my heart
how the patriarchy unfolds
What did i do?
I haven’t actually watched it, so I only know them as the cool lesbains
oh okay fair enouh
only excuse i’ll allow
not you choom
But I have no plans to watch it either
They are cool lesbians
Except for the fascism
f*scism l*sbian
And Vi’s emo arc being one montage
Literal sin
dude biggest fumble
her emo arc breathed life into me when the trailers came out
The amount of times in this show shit could have been ok and then jayce appears out of the hextech aether to fuck it all up 😭

it’s a shame he’s so fine
The best part of the fascism was the ginger dying
yesss
rip girlie
Literal traitor btw
lifeweaver skin when
for viktor ofc
Hes literally doing the zen pose
u might be onto smth
but also lw sits on his petal
so he sits
Jayce the Rien skin
And he’s got his equivalent of the iris
The fanservice forging scene being more than the actual sex
okay stop proving me wrong
REAL
BOTH SEX SCENES
there are two
forging scene is unnecessarily hot and steamy
Can’t forget jinx aura farming for no reason
hotter and steamier than the joint viktor breakdown and jaymelsex
she’s just like that
His breakdowm was soo cool tho 😭😭😭😭
Sex was cool to ig
viktor🤩 oh i guess mel and   jayce getting at it is hot aswell..
The vi and cait scene
don’t sppil
Makes america canon

Im at sheffield
Shits good at this uni ngl
encountered a china town
hope has been raised to being my 2nd choice chat
my predicament remains
the course is better here but the uni and accom is worse
than sheffield
so imma still pick
sheffield methinks
At least it’s easier to get to
mehhh
sheffield is quicker and it’s a liccle more manageable
but a wingstop has been located gang ts is a great day
the extent of liverpool’s massiveness is lowkey insane
how am i supposed to decide if i wanna come here or sheffielf
You make a decision
It doesn’t get easier than that

it’s so hard i wish to take action against my life
Ceylan made a definite and irreparable decision?
i did the whole thing in dark angel green only to discover i hated dark angel green and had to repaint it all black
Nah youll do great mate dw
ITS AO HARD
don’t even.
Be careful repainting can lose detail in the model
Which is terrible on those ones
audio omitted
i knowwww but i had no choice
Just use a small amount on edges
Like literally nothing
so tricky bro..
Use so little
like smidgeon
Yup
Less
I’d honestly leave highlights until you’ve trained brush control a lil more
Tbf yeah
You can always come bavk
but the highlights are the staple😭😭😭😭😭😭
Gotta get a feel for how paints spread and consistency first
Guys DMF is great
They areee but there so hard and can look so ass when done wrong
but also lowkey i’m kinda goated with the small brush and i didn’t realise
Trust me 🫩
😭😭
Its the best one
But for edge highlighting
Use a longer brush
And use the edge (no shit)
Makes it easier to apply less IMO
And say it with me now
✨ignore the box art✨
Truth
Your own style is always better
To look at and to paint
Hi guys
But inspiration dont hurt
Omg hi gurly ✨✨🪄
And you gotta set a reasonable expectation ong

Sup
Hey girlllll
I bought some cheap cok
Oooh

Every time I play the story I just think “that character should have just died, it would’ve been so much better” and it’s not that I don’t like the character, I just think of your going to kill a character, resurrecting them so quickly kinda defeats the point of it

Nah by now it’s just tomorrow
Good morning chat
How are we all on this glorious day of our moon?
Morning
Chat
Y’all know how I think ai is cool as fuck right
https://youtu.be/5KVDDfAkRgc?si=rg1A3bcuL_-tyb5v
Ja
Watch the video
I am
This isn’t like a “ooh ai is gonna end the world” thing
But
It’s VERY easy for that to happen
And potentially within the next few years
This is the first time that I am actually concerned about about ai development
DYDE THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING
you all made fun of me
but i know i was rifht
I didnt
ai development is detrimental
It might be
It depends on what happens
Ai is not explicitly a bad thing
It’s all about how we go about building it
The morality of ai
Or alignment
I’m still not anti ai
In fact
Quite the opposite
I want to make my way into the industry as soon as possible
But the fact that that industry could be gone by the time I get there is genuinely terrifying
i’m thinking more about the day to day aspects that ai can ruin
like skill regression
or even framing of crimes
it’s so easy to develop videos of people doing things
Did we?
like at work people use ai to make the development reports like whatt
yes you and stan
Well, apologies
What skills do you think would go first?
maths
then very quickly literacy
What calculations or actual maths?
So first and foremost, people don’t need ai to regress in mathematics
Same is true for literacy
People don’t generally hold onto it past high school
how have you missed the point
I think before thinking if ai is ruining skills you should look at the actual skills of our country
Tool ai like autocorrect, has already regressed literacy imo
We are in a nation composed and run by actual fucking idiots
What is your point out of curiosity and understanding ?
you don’t ‘need ai to regress’ but it’s certainly allowing people and children to regress at an alarming rate
we did ts case study at school about how ai is affecting education in primary and secondary
Thats fair i think i understand now
Ahh i get you know
I don’t think so, i would argue that it isn’t inherently ai that ruins education but rather the mis appropriation and mis handling by education institutions
You think the ability to learn is regressing yes?
Ai can be a tool just like autocorrect
But it needs to be something we teach students how to use
no but the ability to develop critical thinking and original thoughts is diminishing
Not just demonise it
Hold on people one at a time
Lets have a formal discussion here
well yeah, the same way drugs are bad but only when misused and they’re literally only misused
look at the reform supporters in out generation and tell me about the critical thinking skills we have to lose <This message was edited>
Right
This video talk about the loss of jobs amd the freedom ai would maintain more or less
dude this tells me we need to hold onto our critical thinking not to allow it to diminish further with ai🥀🥀
But ai isn’t only misused, just this week my class was taught how to use it appropriately and i can assure you the vast majority of them did
It acting independent of its owners
yeah but you’re class are people who are lawfully aligned who want to work in law enforcement
I SAW
Yes
Thats the alarming part
it’s insan
Is AI just lurking in the internet acting on its own whims
Most of them hang at the smoke shed and buy drugs from photography students
Don’t over estimate my kin
Untraceable and unstoppable
like seperate from skill regression, we’re literally on our way to creating  something more intelligent than ys
Well yes but no
It would stilll be limited by our cumulative knowledge
But the difference would be it would have all of it
One human can be knowledgeable in like one to 3 topics at best
Thsi would know all of them
ai doesn’t have factors like memory loss and skill regression to worry about, and it has access to all online info it can summon almost instantly — humans literally cannot hold that much info
EXAFTLYYY
Yes
But Ai for now
Would still be limited by human knowledge
It cant learn past us for now
for now
As AI cannot act in the physical world
And anything it builds will not surpass humans
they have ai robot models btw
Well tbf ai does have skill regression, as the ai will eventually fill its own information sources with its own summarised information. Think if a picture losing resolution the more you screenshot it <This message was edited>
Ah yes
Eating its own tail
Ouroborous
Like cropping an image over and over again
Yup
Decreasing its potency
at the minute yeah, but companies are  continuing to develop and improve them
That isn’t a problem you can develop out
It is still reliant for now on the internet
It’s inherent to how language models work
Which is filling with well
Brainrot
Not in a funny way
Just bad information
And literal brainrot
Cant be helping the ai
Its when an AI can disregard other AI spurced that it gets interesting
Sources
I feel like ai is going the same way as y2k
Thabk you ceylan
no worries
But no
The worrying part is
also ai is replacing real artists and actors and writers btw!
From a geography standpoint
Oh its gonna get worse
Is that AI will entirely replace our quarternary sector of jobs
Which for reference
Is the fastes growimg and most viable job sector
Anyone here remember when people said computers were gonna ruin the art industry as it took all the skill out of painting?
genshin actors are on strike because hoyo want to replace them with ai and they won’t give consent, shit like character ai is using writers works to create their own, books are being released for ai, there are so many ai bands popping up , ai generated movies and art too
Anyone remember when that actually happened
YURPPP
People do you understand thisnis worse than art?
Thisnid literally the entire global economy being de humansied
yurppp
so many jobs are gonna be lost
MY job will be gone before i get thefe
University will be usless
As uni only gives quartenary and tertiary jobs
We’re closer to the end of the world than we were in the cold war anyway, might aswell enjoy the ride before we reach the end of the tracks.
stan mate
when i get you
Riot anyone?
Maybe don’t do that
Why not
Change only comes through action
dude nah i gotta do my assignments bro
Power only comes to those who will do anything to take it
YUrpp
agreed
Ok silco
Same 🫩
Chill out
FUCK
He got me
not an insult btw
Literal silco quote
Ik
oh my god
you’re right
Tjats hwy i said it
i didn’t even realise
Cuz youd all understand
How right he is
Not a real arcane fan
dude my head is filled with nothing but the poppy wat
Valid
i’ve tried to read 2 books, got like a hundred pages in and i can’t enjoy it
the poppy war trilogy has ruined literature for me
Can’t a guy enjoy caitlyns fascist arc 😞
NO
Anyhow
Back to the very seripus matter
How do we not lose pur jobs?
dude we ain’t gonna be able to do shit abt ai tho bc it’s being used so widespread
yk i saw sooo many add the other day that were just ai generated
in that little snippet
think about how many jobs were lost
Thats tool AI as well 😭
actors, lighting, filming, audio
The harmless one
*
yeah  but as a result the funding is being put into ai as a whole
Yep 🫩
Welp bacl to the mines
coalville moment
RPCK AND STONE
i’m going back to girlrotting in the car
(music and staring out the window)
Yippee
Valid asf
Thank you both for a good talk on AI
I know they’re both currently based off the same transformer model, but I was referring to agi and asi not llms
Ah fair
I don’t believe we’ll get true agi without a new model
Because the transformer is purpose built for llms
It takes in text and outputs text
Everything after that is a manipulation of that output
Cuz multimodality and shit
Anyway, everyone please watch this video
If you haven’t already
i shall once i’m on wifi
remind me
gang i’m starting a new book series (7 in the series) and hopefully it lives up to the poppy war
it’s got better ratings than the poppy war
and it’s got that sort of epicness and maturity to the narrative that like
i
My dad has just made a very good point on this conversation
He says that AI cant really replace us due to it looking at humans through a digital context
Therefore its data and knowledge isnt true to wjat we are
What do you mean?
As in an AI made to replace idk and anylitcal data worker
Cant really understand itnin the same way a human can
Yes and no
As it can only see through the eyes of the internet
Not through the information in the real world
Yes in the sense that it literally understands differently
No in the sense that they will still give the same result
Amd there's so much context and information not on the internet
True
But it wont, itll be close but not quite
Uncanny valley yk
Yeah
Not acceptable
Agi as a concept results in machines that work the same way humans do
Or at least give the same end product
An employer will still want accurate information and until AI can understand both digital and physical contexts of info it wont replace a lot ofnour jobs for now
We are rapidly approaching that point
Where they can have that context through physical bodies
Can ai read?
Yes
It can
That requires them being given access to books
Or being accepted in a workplace
But also a lot of our information is also oral
I agree that there is a lot of context to the world that ai doesn’t get because it isn’t human and doesn’t live in the real world currently
And contextual
But I honestly believe that will change within the next few years
And books contradict each other all the time
Then there's the shear volume of books to be read
Yeah
that make it all the more dangerous tho right ?
inaccurate and uninformed ai taking jobs and being used for tools
holy shit guys there’s 78 chapters in the first book
i think i’m in for some peak
Gl broseph 🙏
it’s lowkey very similar to red rising and red rising was a great fixation of mine so i think im abt to be changed
Take gpt5 for example
But if it isnt accurate it wont be used
It is both informed and accurate
can ai differentiate fiction from reality too
An inaccurate AI would cost a lot of money
And can search the internet for anything
does it take the bible and fucking rapunzel as fact
History is nearly indistinguishable from fiction at points
Generally I think it can
tbh
But that’s more down to training
but then again
can humans
It’s plausibility
Difference being you can employ a competent human
Trained specifically for the task
You can’t quite do that with ai yet
Because training is expensive
Yeah
And so is running models like gpt 5
Human training is down to the individual
Yeah
It’s easier to train humans
And cheaper
So weve got some time
That’s what I’m saying
For the employer always
OHHHH HES CREATED A LABGUAGE FIR THE BOOK
OH YEAHHHH
i can feel it that this is gonna be good
Already know tis gon be peak
It’s not now, just soon
Within the next few years
My dad thinks well likely have technical security avalanche before an AI problem
I can see that
Where errors in technical security causes worldwide problems
Liek today
But I also think that ai will be the cause of those problems
Have you seen the news today?
The models blackmailing employees to avoid shutdown?
Will you a ho
My aunt told me off for flagging you
And hypothetically leaving them to die
No that a lot of information collecting services have gone down due to a bug in the system found in virginia
No
I haven’t heard about that
Which has shutdown not only a large portion of social media
But also the U.S tax service
May have to check my information again
But still
One error
Has caused so many more
Yeah
Major banking errors too
Which will create more problems elsewhere
Like a snowball
Global dependence on an interlocking net of systems leaves it open to collapse
Yeah that’s gonna be a problem
Globalisation is unavoidable
It just is
I’m not on about globalisation <This message was edited>
Ey?
Its a dedicated part of our modern corpotocracy
Thats what that means mate?
Thats globalisation
I know it’s unavoidable
I wasn’t saying it was bad i was just presenting a fact
They are the key to our interconnectedness and our better lives
Unfortunately
Unfortunately
They drive a lot of modern development
And surveillance
TNCs are annoying for that
What
That has no relevanve to development?
A large amount of modern systems also serve to collect data from the users and coalesce it
oh gangggg i’ve been pulled in 
the first chapter is set at the end of the narrative where he’s been imprisoned for his crimes (blowing up a sun and killing billions) and we’re working backwards to future out how he got there and holy moly bro i already want to consume this at an alarming rate
Increased flows of information allow for better connectedness
i’m putting this down and i’m gonna read it when i have time to fully dedicate my thoughts to it
bedtime n that
Allowing for better flows of labour and capital
It’s also sold
Cold?
Usually to advertisers or other companies
Ok
Reject cookies chat
They’re the root of all evil
Always
fr?
i always allow
Yeah
Never trust cookies from a witch
why are they bad
They vollect your information to allow them to better advertise to you and other businesses related to that website
That is you consenting to have your data monitored, collected and eventually sold
why’s this bad
Because you don't know where it goes
god forbid i get target audience accurate ads😖
It goes to anyone
what info tjo
what info are they taking
Everything
literally it cannot be everything
what spefiically
But it can also involve your computer specs, ip address, sometimes even actual address
.
right
other than my adress i don’t really care
i see nothing wrong with this ivl
Ceylan
Your login information?
To your personal account?
OH I SEE
Literally any mf could just enter your shi
Your ip address
But its fine
that’s unfortunate considering i use the same user and password for everything
Your name
They promise not to 😇
i trust them😇😇
Same 😭
You have no chouce sadly 🫩
it’s sarcastic 😖😖
The internet is a free place
Void of law
Fuck im bad at reading people
Mb cuh
But you can request them to delete your information, some companies make it really difficult to do so tho
Use a vpn and reject cookies chat
Become ungovernable
Cough cough Riot cough cough
The company
Not the action
Could do that tho
Could be a fun activity
Im down
Hit it stan
Lets start a riot?
Nah
Three days grace? <This message was edited>
I foresee something
Predict almost
I predict a riot
Anyhow
Centralisation of power in government
Yes or no
No
To the government bit
Also separation of buisness and state?
Hang the rich
.
.
Same thing really
Yup
Bring it all down
Cyberpunk style
It means no outside motive can affect real decisions hopefully
Also chat
We already had church and state
Lets have business and state
Ja
I don’t want to alarm anyone but in cyberpunk around this time in history the internet was destroyed by being filled with rogue Ais
We are in the bad timeline
Oh.
Thats nice
On the brightside
Lock and load choombas
Its time to chrome the fuck up
We had no johnny silverhand in 23
Luigi mangioni
Not the same as literal terrorism
Basically the same act tho
And levelling of a city
Kickstarts a revolution in my mind
Its not tho?
Hang the rich
Its about starting a movement
Youd like sheffield stan
Theres so many posters about rebelling against the rich
Wickeddd
No future
Like literally thousands
Lets fucking burn it all down
Break it apart
Melt it down amd reforge something great
Coup anyone?
Down
FOR BRETWALDA!
For whatever that guy said!
The one above all Britons
One to lead us to glory
I predict a riot just came on
Its a sign chat
So leicester
Council offices
Anyone wanna go to a protest????????
1230 next week?
Sounds good
maybe abolish land owners and tax the super rich🥺🥺
Bring the stuff
We’re gonna do more than tax them
Read back thats what we agree on
Guys 444 messages
Chill
can we kill them idk
No
The time for action is now
i don’t believe in political violence❤️
I do
Seperation of business and state
yurppp
The time for talk is over
Its time for action
dude we ain’t gonna be able to do shit cmon
Doomfist ahh quote
our asses are 18 year old students with 0 power or influence
cmon
But
Did the suffrage think that?
We can make firebombs
Did the french think that
Did all our colonies think that
No
ironically antivist just started playing
They fought and wkn
but they had hella numbers
and sacrifice
Then we sacrifice
We can get both
We bleed
unless there’s a large movement i ain’t doing shit
We fight
I would rather go for regulation of ai development tbh
speak for yoursel
We rally
Call your friends and your friends friends
Make sure there’s still jobs
Lets start a riot!
Allå til mig!🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪
Gott mit uns
To quote brig
BASED
See this guy gets it
oliver sykes the man you are
Im gonna love uni chat
me too
can’t wait to be surrounded by left wing people
Me too
Geography is so much about action
I cant wait to be surrounded by right wing cops
I prefer balance
To have a good rounder argument
you know it’s proven that people who attend university education are more likely to be left wing. education = left wing. coinciddence me thinks not
Yeah i can dig that
The right tend to be blue collar
Which is why you need botj
Apprentices and tradesmen
sadly
No world can stand without a stromg foundation
and that ain’t ever gonna happen let’s be fr
there’s zero scenario people stand together
Unless we make it happen
unless we face some other wordly threat i’ll
*idk
Tear it all down
Time to chrome the fuck up samurai
oh my lord
Have hope
We got the chrome and the shitty politics
We live in cyberpunk now
But we do
We face the rise of the right
So lets get some fucking eddies choombas
The loss of our jobs
The deprivstion of rights
OUR rights
The loss of our planet
The lackluster market for jobs and money
unfounded optimism guys
The widening gap of wealth
Not unfounded
Statistically proven
Hope is needed
Its not optimism if we have action
Always
Only through hope can action happen
Point is
There is plenty to fight for
And if we do our part
Power will only come to those who will do anything to take it
Eventually the machine answers
And if not
The machine breaks
Biscuits better
Chat icl that video has brought some massive uncertainty into my career plan
I genuinely don’t know whether to keep going
Join us
How so?
I’m not sure
I guess it’s still the same question
Is it worth the effort
Is what?
Getting the grades I need at a level
To do ai at uni
The experience is worth more than anay wage
Well regardless of what you do at uni good grades can’t hurt
9 days choom
Any*
Trust me oscsr
Fuck yes choombatta
You will love uni
Especially if its something you love
Ok
Good
Right
Back tp the conversation of political action
EAT THE RICH!
Maybe start soemwhere more grounded
We need to act if we want change
Is that better
A tower of oppression cant be knocked dowm
Itnwill only crush those who oppose it
It must be torn dowm
Thoroughly and carefully
We may need a man on the inside
Not true
Do what you think younwould enjoy
Happiness always comes first
I’m the man on the inside
The difference between turning their own tech against them or bringing it all dowm
with what alevels you’re doing oscar you’ve got a massive amount of careers you could go into, don’t stress about it at this tome
Shes right
Enjoy your first year
yurppp
let the existential crisis hit later
Worry about uni towards the end of first and ghe beginning of second
Year*
well maybe a bit earlier than that
i started uni shit in january
Yeah thats fair
i’d already been to 3 unis by march
4 i think actually
I still haven’t started uni shit

Cuz you get college benefits when applying
Did someone say benefits?
@ceylan

As the ops would say
Well this has been a wonderful talk on political action
All i can say is choose your associates carefully
Yall are associating?
With a political group 🫩

Love the green party

Protesting is fine?
Its not illegal?
Ok
So

Yeah I know nothing about any of the parties to choose between tho
educate yourself lil bro💯
Green is da best colour
I decided to go take a look at the llm book I got for Christmas again

Yippee
Hooray
Peak?
Dont you do it.
Anyway

I will attempt to implement this later when my laptops new charger arrives
Cuz it killed itself yesterday
Mine carked it as well
Yeah
So I made my own weighting algorithm
Battery ist kaput
And its shit
And terrible
But I made it with no help
So I’m proud of it
But its a start
So I’m now going to make another with guidance from a guy who actually know what he’s on about <This message was edited>
Sounds good bro
Yup
Yippee, it’s much easier to improve bad code than it is to improve no code
I have about until the end of year 12 to have a working prototype
And the end of year 13 for hopefully an end product
You can do it
Thanks dude
We believe in you brosephy
Chat im now very seriously considering goimg into politics after uni

I just had a stroke
Of fucking genius
Ooh
What if
What if
I stick my pc
In this bad boy
Fresh from the 90s
Sleeper pc of the century
Although I will need to work out airflow
This thing has a grand total of 1 fan
Normal cases have around 7
And I think this is a micro atx motherboard
I hope
If it’s not then we’ll have a problem
And doing this will save me around £50
Drill air holes? <This message was edited>
It’s unfortunately not quite that simple
Hang it out a window?
Even if I removed the top and added screw holes for exhaust fans, there would still be stuff in the way
Even if I removed the top and added screw holes for exhaust fans, there would still be stuff in the way
And also unfortunately I want to keep that shit because it’s cool
Though half of the disk readers are in sizes I’ve never seen before and more than likely will never use
There’s also a sound card
And it actually has some useful things on it like a MIDI port
But I don’t think I’ll be able to use it because the case only has 4 slots
And the gpu will take up 3.5 of them
Which doesn’t leave enough room for the sound card’s 1 slot requirement <This message was edited>
Airflow will be a diy project <This message was edited>
But other than that I just need to check that the motherboard will fit and then i should be fine
just watching my dude😡😡
Damn that’s a long show

Very funny jackass
Be nice stan
It was a harmless joke
I am being nice

I have to remind everyone this is satire
This is a marine being a goober (as they are known to be) on his last day of work

google him idk
i love when the autism concentration kicks in and 4.5 hours of building gluing and  critical role fly by
Powerwash 2 is peak
So fucking real
Honestly i put the same song on loop for like 6 hours and then never listen to it again
real asf
Its the rhythmn bro
Once you get the batch painting .mindset time flies
bro paintin is so hard
it’s all so jard
i don’t have patience for it
Pendulum has swung back
Neither it why ive stopped as of recent
Too much effort and i burnt out
And i cant start a new army
damn
i’m also lying because evidently i DO have the patience for it
but it still makes me tweak
I need me a stealth suit killteam
Get a job
No
I'm gonna become an elf for Christmas chay
Chat
Hwy?
Well you already fit at least half the requirements
Fuck you
Im recommend father Christmas bc of my experience chat
And then his elves.
Your experience?
Work experience
Doing?
Or just working at all?
Yes
Technically I have almost 15 years of experience
Bc of my brother
Hyehyehye
I have retail experience, experience with kids and with disabled ppl
Ooh nice
😝
Hay gentlemen, ladies and anything in between I have just had the thought that at some point later either this year or next year I would like to run a one shot with the original idea for what we were going to do in dnd. Dwarfs. If your down then reply to this. If ppl want it the date is very variable and I can work to anyone’s schedule.
Why are we being my aunt <This message was edited>
GANGGG
critical role campaign 4 is unbelievably good
genuinely
oh my god
and the fantartists bro..
ahat
fanartists
Im guessing peak has been found?
Bet campaign 2 still better
not watched
YES
Bet
Thoughts
Can I join and have a go at it?
Sure
If you want to
we on a  roll
a..critical role…
My fingertips hurt looking at thag
This pains me to think about constructing
okay i’m done
video omitted
you know whay
it was actually super wasy
very easy
a lot easier than lady malys
Fair nuff then
lady malys brought me to tears
but painting this thing may just kill me
Paint away oh mighty painter
bro i am NOT painting ts shit today..
i’m gonna build eveyrthiny girst
Yeah can i recommend breaking off the arms when you do?
so the paint induced suicide can come later
i shant do that
Why
bc i already put them on type shi
Glue aint set yey
You have 2 hours of malleablity for the glue
nah it’s all good i’ll suffer later
Suffer?
Fair enough
As you have?
Might i recommend in future for larger models that you paint as you build
It makes it easier to get into hard spaces
As there not covered yet
Bru
Shouldn’t you focus on your actual campaign?
What the one I’m running at school
Or the one with you guys
Cuz u can plan a one shot alongside both of them
The one with us
video omitted
Zamn peak
Is that all glued down?
don’t even.
i’ve realised my folly as  i’ve primed them
we no longer have clear bases
Its fine
1. We have spairs
nah it’s all good i have a plan
2. If your careful you cam remove the people
Oh yes?
And tell me when the next session of that is planned
Or even approximated
It isn’t
You tell us its your campaign?
1. Fair
2. ⁠every time I suggest a date either some people can’t make it or it’s booked for something else
When have you suggested a date before?
I did it a while back but Stan said it was booked for cyberpunk
Or something
That was three months ago now
Anyway right now I’m not gonna worry about that campaign as it happens once in a blue moon due to timing so I might as well plan a one shot alongside it
It’s all good
So are you interested in the premise
What premise?
You said one word
I think we’re at a point where we’re starting to value roleplay and character growth more than stats and combat, so some longer narrative experiences would be preferable
Cough cough @William Stothard
Fair
Ja still one word
"dwarfs"
Holup
That was the original plan for dnd
POLL:
What do you value in DND
OPTION: Roleplay (5 votes)
OPTION: Combat (2 votes)
OPTION: Exploration/puzzles (2 votes)
In like 22?
It was last year but yeah
critical role has proved to me that roleplay is genuinely so much better than every other aspect of the game
i get sooo inspired watching it
Your all dwarfs in a cave that have been recruited by your local king to fight off some evil creatures that dwell deep in the mines
Yeah tbf when writing my campaign i like to think of all the interactions you lot would have
If you can write it we'll play it
we down for anything fr
Fair reminder that im hosting a taster session gor GH at some point next month
Few things to keep in mind when watching cr 1. Their campaigns are created from the start to last for years 2. They are all professional actors with years of experience in dnd

Just keep these things in mind when watching and then playing so that you don’t have to high of expectations of this group btw I know that sounds harsh but non of us have comparatively that much experience
Anyway
It’s also scripted btw
Which helps
That too
Surely not fully?
My session won’t be in the next month it would probably be after new years
Tbf we have ben, who makes roleplay very difficult imo
No but the group is railroaded more than you’d think
He’s definitely not made it easy
yeah yeah ofc but it’s still so nice to watch
No he fucking terrifies me
professional dnd ofc were never gonna match up to it
but it’s a point of inspiration
Ja
yeah fr..
Does he?
It feels like he brushes over our roleplay opportunities sometimes
yk yesterday he didn’t like that i used my giant insect to put 10 centipedes down so he straight up wasted 2 5th even spells so i couldn’t have cool shit😭😭😭
Yeah it does
he also admitted it was to ragebait me😭😭😭😭
We get to a moment where roleplay could be really good but he just timeskips to the next key moment
Mofucker can be a little bit of a killjoy somedays
Killjoy?
dude i don’t even remember last ben session in main campaign
I do have to say he could be a bit less psychotic
Uhhhh
although 1st session of this oneshot was really good i enjoyed
Sad i wasnt there 🥺
It also feels like he doesn’t let characters be as serious as we would want
Real
Berserkers?
Yep
elaborate plz🗿
The berserker cave
We were in the dollhouse I think and albus had just died
In icewind dale
No that was the last campaign session
That was written by javk dnd
We’re talking about the last time was dming <This message was edited>
Ah
I kinda felt that during the start of the last main campaign session with us being robed taking the focus away from the fact that a guy had just removed my legs and threatened to kill all of you
no yeah fr
That was again a jack dnd thing
Kinda actually yeah
nah it wasn’t
ben interfered
The cool revenant was ben
jack dnd said he didn’t plan that
But also we all moved on pretty quick from that
What the leg thimg or being robbed?
leg thing
Well no we spent some time making new legs
Ben does have a thing with doing overkill
Yeah got it
A little yeah
Tbf i got shafted when honu was introduced
Didn't get to choose my introductiin 🫩
I don’t even remember you being introduced
the sister has got this whole arc going on but it doesn’t actually make sense with the dnd lore itself so i spoke to ben about it and his response was kinda just ‘it’s happening with this because i said so’ and i was like okay!
Albus got shafted during the carnival
Did he?
Ben trying to kill him and all
Oh yeah
Well tbf ben offered to fix it
Oscar denied
No it got changed
Yeah thats fair tbh the lore in the end is what the DM says it is
Beford that
It feels like he has his characters get really satisfying introductions and displays of power, but we don’t get the opportunity to even feel like a competent group
but not when there’s direct contradiction with certain rules in the game
Ben offered to pull him out be he denied
like i can’t explain without giving spoilers but it literally doesn’t woro
work*
No thats still fine rules should never interupt fun
If its cool
Its goes past usually
its not that like
hmm
let me just spoil
Wait
the god he’s allocated me
Dont
literally does not work
with that the sister wants
but she’ll give me what i want bc ben wants her to
Wait he allocated for you?
like he literally could just give me a different god
And what does the sister want, beyond children?
Not you choosing for yourself
Get tf out
spoilers choom
It does feel like midus got boiled down from the grandeur your supposed to have, but that may be the fault of our less serious characters adopting his worship <This message was edited>
Idk if thats solely ben
Does she not collect every child she sees?
Not entirely i suppose
yeah the sister absolutely would not worship a party god and i made it clear she was a christian dupe man😭😭
in no way would she have worshipped the same god as you hooligans
Damn
Hooligans?
What booze is gonna be there
ysah
On 31st
That is definitely more our fault than ben
all the booze ever
*Bring your own
Ill have you know honu is very serious
There’s gonna be too much blood in our alcohol streams

It felt good the first few times but after a while the drawbacks become clear
Come cv, there’s plenty
Got to love looking like a yellow Lego man
dude i’ve smoked like 7 times now and genuinely i’ve yet to feel anything good from it so im convinced it’s just a placebo effect
It is
Thats how addiction works
I think you just got cheap cigarettes
But also don’t
Its the same gor alcohol
nah i didnt
The good does not ouweigh the bad
nah alcohol i can see why you’d become addicyed
and that isn’t just the genes talking
Yeah tis fun

What....
If only you could write that much
if only..
hang in only 50 pages in
i started reading like an hour and a half ago
the pages are so big and the writing is so small and it’s so complicated that i have to read most sentences two or three times
but it’s so good i swrar
the writers prose is actually incredible i couldn’t ever think to word things like that
Ewww reading
Ooh how so? I do enjoy good writing
it’s just like
he says so much in so little words
like
it’s just incredible
Concise but effective ?
everything is so intentionally said and it builds this incredible amazing picture
Crazy how @ceylan texts how she speaks
well long and efgectice
is this now how it works
🙁
Just saying
Don’t we all text like we speak?
Seems a lil strange cuh
that’s what i’m saying
I mean yea but like some people sound very different over text
yeah true
but i always find that pretentious
when i see people doing that
like sybau and talk to me normally
cos what is texting if not conversing in non verbally
why would i be a diffetent person  through this
*in a non verbal manner
yeah thanks man
Is that not what she said?
More or less
Cos, gonna, y’all ,shoulda? Woulda, innit, cuh, smh.

was thinking maybe a smaller centipede
and maybe a bat
Ja
Just bicep?
nah not doing bicep stuff til i lose weight
gonna avoid the places that will change shape drastically
Fair nuff
Forearm?
yurp
Ooh idea
left arm sleeve
Alternatively, big one all up your back
eventuall
when i have full time job money
Have it end under a smaller tattoo so that the sleeve can continue later after youve lost the desired weight?
idk what that means
As in have the centipede's end be hidden
OH RIGHT
yeah
So it can continue seemlessly up your arm
so it can be extended later
i get you
Yeaah
Are you gonna sit and make sure it has the right number of legs tho?
No?
that’s the tattoo artists job😭😭
Rule of coll bro
Cool*
Don’t want to end up with a millipede
Bro regardless of legs
It will look dope

Chat whag utter peak

Wouldn’t jayce fit rhein better?

HEIMERDINGER TORB?
?
Sky's death man 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ong
Heimerdinger as ball????
🤨
What
Whats wrong william
Peak?
ekko as lucio ofc
Ofc
mel as illari
vi as possibly zarya ?
Hmmm
Maybe
Megarda as sojourn
Fullstop.
Mel or ambessa?
Ambessa
I woulda thought she would be a tank
What
Peakcane
Jq then
Ik races dont match but still
That’ll do
I thought i was reading another language
U r
I’m more thinking mechanics and weapons
Ja
Vander as rein?
YES
He doesn’t know
winston….
I do and i dont
Yeah i get that one
But pre that vander
Defo rein
Hmm
Yo sevika as hazard?
Vi as df
?
Vi as df makes sense
But sevika does the one arm thing two
And has the larger build
Vi as ram
Hmmm maybe
vi as ram is ridonculus
Yeah..
Hazard for sevika makes sense imo
From a mechanical standpoint
Does it?
Cus she gets a nee bigger and better arm in s2
And a bowl cut but we don’t gotta mention that
Ya butvi as df fits better
How?
@ceylan help me out here
I’m the only one whos watched the whole show
Well Oscar too
But hes not here
K so df fits better for vi seeing as she is more calculated in her fighting compared to sevika who is much more brutish in how she attacks
Possibly
But doomfists abilities all link to big and devastating attacks which allow for situation control, which fits sevikas style more accurately
Hmm maybe but the df playstyle of hard and fast
Is quite literally how vi fights imo
She boxes
Sevika brawls
Exactamundo
Hence hazard
Who gets stuck in
But hazard doesn’t actually do any of the things sevika does
Knife arm
Purple liquid
Need i say more
Well sevika doesn’t have a knife arm
Not anymore sadly 😔
Only time in the show she ever does that btw
Ja
But go on
What would vi be then
Wait till you see her new arm
?
I’m not sure
don’t even talk abt this
this didn’t happen
Vi literally has a punk arc
So idk
Fucking
Hell
Yeah not a good look
Holy fuck the banquet seen at the end of season 1
What about it
Jinx committed terrorism is aura
Combined with “what could have been” is an amazing moment

Better option, enjoy this momentous holiday however you see fit
You've got a function after so maybe stick to like 4
Peer pressure aint real gang
Then you'll have room for more after
sounds about right
But the benefits of reaching a drunk high quicker means more whimsy
More ill the next morning
Drink water then you aight
Unlucky
Better yet
Consume bread

You pull someones leg

Tbf they do
I do not go around grabbing peoples private bits
Can be and people can still think its weird still
EXACTLY
Thats not very punk of you
Pulling on yo genitals for shiggles
yeah basically
It’s like literally just a saying
exactly
Also a large demographic of people hate immigrants, doesn’t make it right
oh ymngod
this
Yk what else is just a saying
this is uncalled for my boy i am so political bruu
The N word cuh
Holy fuck why did this get political so fast
Racism isn't real
i got bullied in high school for telling people off for saying the n word n f slur cuh😭😭
??????
Homophobia isn't real
gay people aren’t real there i said it
And it’s taken this long for ceylan to realise i just ragebaited them in the same way they tried to do so to me <This message was edited>
Its just ppl being insecure ong
ragebait treads a thin line to just being a total IDIOT
dick head

Bring the receipt so ik how much i owe ong
yurppp
Imma send my robot hand to go steal yo drink
Im drinking it all
Ill bite the fingers off
That’s plastic and metal
And?
And there’s better places hands can be used
Many drinks to be held and drank
Many hugs to give, makeup to apply, and board games to beat people at
Hands are multipurpose
Hold 2 different alcoholic beverages
Also @ceylan @River can yall do my makeup again? (And hair?)
Yes
Use the full arm, you get lik three a side
Hells yeah
What do you want doin
Halloweenie 😛
ya but i can’t bring my own
Yall can go crazy
I can make it look like someone hit you ong
By hitting you
HELL YEAHHH
SFXXXX
And also makeup
oh
YEWAAAAAAA
I won so many years in a row using it
I also have none of my own
Trolled my parents with it too
OMG NAILSSSSS
I was a jokester
AAAAYYYYY
Not on the new hand tho
Chat [sorry to be so depressing] but you ever get that feeling where it feels like your soul is sinking into your body?
Yeah
I kinda feels like I’m sinking through my own body sometimes, and it’s fun, idk if that’s the same thing
No it feels like theres a weight falling through your stomach
Yes
I understand that feeling
Sorry to ruin the mood there
Cheers its good to not feel alone
Its okay, we are here for you
Gōd hælo sister
Its just got me debating wether or not to be present at the party, cuz i dont want to have another of my moments
But also i really need to see friends again
Its okay to have a moment
It’s cool to take a break
Just do that inside
And since it's in your home, you already have a safe space to go to if needed
Life is made of moments, why not share them with friends?
And you can always decide a party ain’t write for you atmo, but don’t decide that before trying it out
Is it possible to get an escort to the park in that eventuality?
No
I’m afraid we all gotta stay at home
With the circumstances of the night we can’t let that happen
Ok
Once you're drinking there's no leaving the premises
More like once it’s dark
But yah
No my moments can be pretty scary for everyone who isnt me
Babe it's britian in october
That's like 4pm
That doesn’t change anything?
Being dark is the problem so regardless of when that is thats the cut off
Bet
Alr then
You gotta tell us when those moments happen
Someone at least sit w me in the garden?
Sure
We’ll be out there anyhow
Should be fine
I will
Promise
Pinky promise
I’ll hold you to that
Ill try my best but you have to understand that im trying to separate myself when im anxious, so i might be a bit short of words
“Something is wrong” is all it takes
But i will not leave through the property
But i need you to try and recognise when something is wrong
And act appropriately
I will
Ill get a token or something
Something quick without words
Ok
If thats what works for you
It does
Ill hand the axe to someone
If i hand the axe to you and leave it means i need a break
I was thinking keeping weapons away from the party so maybe sm rlse
Else
Aight bet
Lanyard
Its easy to keep on you
I have a bracelet
That'll work
Ill hand your bracelet to you
The wooden one
Its so cool
Ja
That'll work
Cheers guys
Np brother

First bracer chat
That is very definitely a bracer
Thats the most bracer looking bracer i ever seen
Thank you dakota 🫩
Fuck you all
You did what you set out to do, you successfully made a bracer, well done
💀

Congratulations on making some bracers cuh
Brace yourselves for the second one
That's so funny,
Ong

Y
YAY
Yall get to decide what I play tonight, helldivers or outer worlds 2?
Scrabble.
Outer worlds 2
Aight bet
Actually that raises a point for tomorrow
Should we bring like a board game each?
Bro.
Good idea
Do it
Then we’ll rotate
just card games man
We need shit thats portable
@Leo @Oscar Hunt Brown @ceylan bring a board game tmr
Board games are portable
Also we have a fuckass table
Are they fuck?
What’s the problem with using the table we have
*Some* board games are portable
We'll play bloody boggle mate
I was about to say I don’t have any
Ill thrash ya
But I have some
That will be joyous to play while drunk
POKER RAHHHH
Everyone bring one each
Oh Yeaaaaa
I’m bringing 2 or 3
I doubt they’ll get touched
Cuz they need at least minor brain function
But like
It’d be funny
Should we collaborate so we don’t bring copies? Or would that be part of the fun?
Part of the fun
Nobody knows who’s bringing what
i can bring some lil drinking games
7 copies of monopoly
Nah board games
Nobody is getting hammered
Please do
Cmon stannn
They can be controlled
Its not like we'd be using high content stuff
okok

Hes a musician tho
Id probs end up in tech icl
Or nomad still
Maybe solo for me
With the most combat experience
AC/DC, Alice in chains, or guns an roses
tbh tho if i was in cyberpunk universe id just whore myself out it feels like the least deadly option
i’d get a bit of cash
and i wouldn’t have to deal with combat hopefully
You’ve met the tyger claws right…
alice in chaisn
And maelstrom
ignore them❤️
Depends on where you did so ig
Becoming an edgerunner is the only “free” life out there

Lets get some fucking edds chooms
RAHHHHH

My room is fine
MkAyy
Hello all, I would like to say thank for tonight and that is has been lovely but I have made the decision independently that when a meeting is planned at which drinking and or smoking is possible if not probable I will not be attending. Please understand that is decision has been made not due to anyone or and conduct, I just simply don’t enjoy the environment of being around drunk people. This decision may change in future but for now it is definite
Ok
If it’s not your thing that’s ok man
No offense taken
Glad u enjoyed it sad u won't be coming again
@William Stothard @Stan  left poker at your house could you bring to dnd
Can do
Yep can do
i don’t ever wanna drink again bro🙁
but i am next week
i actually threw up this time like whattt
i haven’t thrown up in YEARS
terrible
i need to reassess my capacity for alcohol
Neither 🫩
Stayed awake till half 4 cuz if upset stomach
How much did you drink?
too much
Guess i walked into that one
So what did we learn?
Alcohol is amazing 🤤 until its not
Tell me about it
No im alr thank you
Chat the Ai confused this duct banana-taped to the wall for a banana duct-taped to a wall, is he stupid?
that i am going to stop drinking vodka for some time
Welcome to the club cuh <This message was edited>
Stick to some beers and casual times
yes
How’d the party go
well i never said i wasn’t gonna get shitfaced i’m just gonna get shitfaced slower and with pints
was good
left at like 11 tho😭😭
jack called my mum😭😭
i think the alcohol isn’t what got me
i had like 3 fags in a row and i’d been vaping all night so i think nicotine made me immeasurably dizzy
Yeah that would do it
It’ll do that
Don’t chainsmoke cuh
Enjoy it in moderation
i am sworn off of smoking and vodka ❤️
Or better learn from this and quit <This message was edited>
Alcohol and nicotine in large quantities does nkt mix well
yuh
Neither does any antidepressants tbh
Yippee congratulations
depressant
Have you considered coke?
😦
Maybe not?
When in doubt, double down.
Cola
Cok
Surefire way to throw up that is
No.
Crack cocaine. <This message was edited>
Shhh
Crack and alcohol do not mix
Again just dont mix any antidepressants ong
yeah it does btw
my brothers way to stay awake enough to have 45 beers in one single drinking session
Mhm sounds good for him
Not for his wallet tho
yurp
£2 each @River @Stan 🥺🥺
There asleep rn i think
Screenshotted
😖
thanks stan
What
Whats wrong <This message was edited>
i was being deadass
thanks for the money
thanks wiver
No problem ml
so now thay everything is over
i need to plan my outfit for next week
my first night out
I thought you already planned it?
nope
it’s fancy dress as something the beginning with the first letters of your name  but only like sorta so i’m going as a cat and i’ll just wear a headband with normal clothes
but idk what the outfit is gonna be yet
What
Wait nvm i get it now
Ceylan get back here
The beats are back on
And we need booze
CEYLANNNNNN
WE REQUIRE THY WISDOM OF AGE
*ID
what
what does this mean
The function is being restarted
Involuntarily
Which raises a ship of Theseus question, is it the same function or another one?
We’re back at it
But we need more hooch cuh
All night all day
Can a grain of sand differentiate between heap amd not heap?
gang don’t day drink
you shall  all be okay
Bu bu but
NOOOOO 😭😭😭
Youre not my mom
Gang the new book has a bard subclass that could easily be silksong
hope not that’d be incest
gang my dnd fixation is going crazy
which is ironic cos it’s a year late
i miss the main campaign 😖😖
Woa
New Druid subclass, take a look at the swarm
Instead of saying sybau
Say
Kindly afford me the tranquility of your silence.
oh this is cold
😛🙏🏻
gang cos my one shot dude is a knight he gets a retainer (who won’t follow into danger) so i get to roleplay two characters for a little while  😝
What's his teeth gotta do with ts
Bro gets to play with herself for a time (authorised by river)
😛
😭😭
WHAT
Not very independent if he has a luggage bitch
that’s cos of the knighthood not the noble origin😝
so smd
I swear the point was to prove his independence
yeah but what papa olfurd doesn’t know can’t hurt him
“Says smd a *LOT* for a woman” - JR sheimpaugh
I’ll tell him
nah
I’m god
I will
nope
Yup
Jawohl
Yo chat
We just had a genius idea
Friday game night
At the stoþard residence
Sober ish event
Drinking should be casual and limited
Like a 2 drinks each
But
But
One glass, it never emptied
2 pints each
That it
Kegs?
Pints
Pints my guy
friday night is father night sadly
unless we do it post 10pm
Could do
awesome sauce
pints and games sounds absolutely mint to me
Prost 🍻
Thank you all for last nice folks, that has gotta be one of my favourite memories that is, Skål everyone! 🍻
Yurr it was great, losing very badly at poker
Better than last time for sure
Group anime definitely made up for it tho
Definitely
Frr
Hungry asf
Dont even i lost on some utter bullshit <This message was edited>
Reallll
New sticker just dropped
PEAK
i need to watch that so bad
it’s been  
on the list for some time
Its so fuvking peak
Watchimg it rn
Its so absolutely peak
did you watch all of it??
Same, we go through like 4 episodes last night
Nah
how many eps in total
24
Each 24 minutes give or take
ah right
only like 8 hours
Bout death note sized
Yeah it’s a short one
Damn quick maths
But yeah its good
Bit one note sometimes
But peak
dude i was an anime binger in high school its engrained into me  now that 3 eps is an hour ong
Fair nuff
2 1/2
Also the intro music is a vibe imo
Along with slight dnd intervals
Padded armor wearing fuck
Chat
Just had a peak idea
Board game night on Fridays start quite late yeah?
Why not cook like a proper meal as a group or sum shi?
Feast n all that
Yes but, it’d be a struggle deciding with enough time and having a lot of people cooking at once
Well i get back at 6
And stan is there all day
In theory we have a week to plan it
But its a suggestion yk
Group meal and all that
Proper meal as well
Perhaps we have the first one or two without, and keep the idea for consideration?
Yeah thats fine by me
Again its a group decision
yeah i agree with ts
this*
However, I have consulted with my wise woman and she says I am dating both Stothards and Jack. She however wants to take all the women
What
After observing last week’s behaviour, she has come to the conclusion that I’m dating all three of you individually
Last week?
She likes women (ig the long hair gives me a pass?)
She came down to play for our anniversary for the end of the one shot
Ohh right
idea
tarot card based dnd one shot
Interesting idea
But counter point
Follow up idea, cards against dnd
go on then
https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1355169627/cyberpunk-tarot-deck-28-cards-phantom?ref=elp_anchor_listing&bes=1&sts=1
that’s not even a counter point
that only convinces me more the idea is goated
I think it’d fit cyberpunk better
yeah perhaps but both can apply
like dm allocates a player a card and bases the plot around those interacting aswell as ‘fates’, and players make characters based around the card and avoiding/achieving said ‘fate’
oh man this is such a cool concept i’m gonna have to plan a book around it and never write it
It would be interesting, but what i feel like you’re building into is a one shot with much more spiritual inspiration
Which in itself is cool
But i think some other concepts could be applied aswell to increase the _*vibes*_
yeah that was my idea
just a one ahot
shot
here bro
like?🙏
I’m not just talking about the tarot
Could also include a much deeper plot involving moral alignments and how actions affect the soul as much as they affect the body
A bit like the last one but much less superficial
right right i get yoj
As in our fates being based on actual actions rather than what ben finds funny <This message was edited>
so maybe in the first session out of two your actions decide your fate card and then like the next one is receiving the card and avoiding or achieving the fate
The tarot does so much more than just determine a fate tho
doesn’t determine fate, only predicts
It does more then that too
It warns and encourages
It makes shady things clear
ya
i think it would be super cool to just have a tarot card reader appear in the main campaign every now and again
like how we see
the weapon due
dude
fuck what’s his name
the gay one
The deck of fates is the dnd equivalent tho
but instead of weapons we get our cards read n shit
then i want this then
Oscars boyfriend?
yeah
We have had it tho
wizard guy
We had that, that’s how you got your wings
did we ?
It got taken away by aegis
The deck of many fates
oh that’s not what i’m talking about then
then gives or takes things
Leo carried for a while
i was talk in about merely predicting
Fate is give or take
talking *
The bones?
I’m not sure how a dm would do that or how it would further the story in any way
I mean if your looking for a fate system in dnd
Grim hollow offers a way for the party to manipulate fate towards good/ away from a certain outcome
Hold on lemme
That chapter of the book will probably help build the idea a little
Allowing the dm to interact more with "fate" in a way thats balanced between players and dm
Instead of dm just having absolute say
just roleplaying a tarot card dealer, having them pull specific cards to clue for the plot it’s not gotta be something mechanical
overthinking man
just roleplay 😭😭
Ben doesn’t do anything except for the plot
Duh thats why one of us does it
my issue bro
that’s the point 😭
Also how many of our *characters* would believe in it?
Bro its fate
Literally everyone
Lucius sure don’t
the sister may keep it in mind but she wouldn’t believe
Well he gay asf then
And what if they were?
Then that's completely acceptable
Good
Inclusion in dnd ong
Zinbella would probably allow it to happen, may take mild interest, but no major ties
I mean no disrespect to homosexuals
We have a gay man in our party
*had
I mean absolute disrespect to lucius
Wait how is albus’ boyfriend gonna react to his death?
SHIT
Is he even gonna find out?
HOLY FUCK
We gotta tell him
the sister canonically had a rebel phase in her early 200s guys n she certainly was slightly promiscuous in that time
men AND women
It would be wrong of us bot to
Dayum
OH MY GOD
I DIDNT THJNK OF THAT
But how
Im her early 200's😭
the ring too
we don’t have the ring to even call him
Ah shit
Fuck
maybe we can patch that
I doubt it
ask ben to have it fall on the grass or smth 🥀
He was with percy in tal dorei right?
Aight who we whoring out for discount magic items
We must return with knowledge of albus’ passing as soon as possible
He did say magic items fell off and got left
I’ll get my dress uniform
Gotta deliver the bad news
Ill get the cape
I’ll get started on a little moss statue
i mean lucius can pretend to be albus right
No
Good idea
No no no no no no no
yes yes yes
Yes yes yes yes eys
I refuse to
you must be gat
gay
I dont believe you have a choice
Its all for the greater good stan
He’d be seen through, but he may appreciate the gesture
Fuck
Also asking him to would be metagaming
But you could decide
Finneee 🙄
Zymbella?
William parrotblade?
Would lucius, the regimented and no nonsense operative intentionally decide to demean himself for free shit
Yes
100%
Depends on the quality of shit
Of bringing comfort to those that have lost
Or*
Its heavily imoral
I can’t pretend to be albus forever
Ughhh fine
Also what if lucius’ personal preferences don’t align with albus’
So whore yourself out
Nah cant do
Goes against tortle biology
Well it can’t be me
Zimbella tho
Telling ya
Or maybe we shouldn’t try and hook  up one of our party members with a recent widow
William parrotbalde
Blade*
Morals guys
Morals
Y’all are meant to be heroes
Maybe, but also I’m half intending to get rid of him semi soon
Not suicidal, just don’t bring him back if it happens
What are those
Something we’re all meant to have
What are morales, if not a cage of the mind, a machination of society meant to restrain those of true ambition and will <This message was edited>
Sarcasm btw
What is truth but a survivor’s story
not really tbh
Wisdom is a curse, an understanding of all that surrounds you, born of the pain of past mistakes
we got dragged into heroness but we are all just protecting to alleviate themselves of their curse
what
i don’t know what i’m trying to say there
Neither
Something about our heroism being a veil for our freedom i think
attempting
that’s what i meant to say
instead of protecting
Got ya
but yea
none of us strive to be heroes
it just so happens that as a result of our goals we have done heroic things
Maybe some do, maybe some are misguided
who’s heroic in the group cmon
You make a fabulous point
i’ve been reading though the mythic odyssey of theros book and it’s lowkey awesome
Tbf honu is renowned in his home region for his acts of heroism
blud has not mentioned it ever sadly
Ooh whats that about?
Never asked
Never find out
it’s lowkey ancient greece in dnd
Sick
ZEEUUUUSSSSS
YURPPP
is this real…
Lucius is anything but a hero
More like an unwilling participant
real
so many times the sister has complained abt wasting time on god
Idk why we specifically have to do all this
Whats wromg with a little whimsy
Our allies have made it clear they have stronger men than us
Were cheap?
Thats the thing you see
the fact she’s more likely to turn into a tree the longer she faffs around
Its easy to buy someone who's never tasted wealth
What are they paying for??
Ah
I do feel like the curses are a bit lackluster/unequal
real
like albus fell into shit if he fell and i’m turning  into a fuckass tree
I DIE if i touch a bird
Like youve got a noticeable but dealable curse that can have real story implications
LMAOOO
Youd never know that
It would just happen
If we have to ride a griffon anywear i’m cooked
We all know our curses
But like my curse isnt even a curse
Technically i think i become downed
Ahh
So i’d like to imagine after enough seizures lucius got the gist of it <This message was edited>
Incapacitated
Ok that makes more sense
bro had to get rid of pet birds real fast type shi
But also jack, leo, me havent really got a serious curse
so basically you have a bird allergy and i got a fucking death curse
You best belive he never took well to falconry
But that's cool tho
Its drives your character
Creates story
she already had a drive😭😭😭
I heard you liked drive
So i added more drive to your drive
How does mine drive me tho
What drives me
What am I…
It doesn't thats my point
Alot pf us are not compelled to interact with the curse thing
Because it has no real consequences for our characters
It doesn’t really tie us together as much as ben would want
Yeah
Thoughts on asking for a curse mulligan?
i feel like it’s become a forgotten aspect of the plot
So we all get an equal level of curse
like it no longer matters that we’re cursed
That actually affects us as characters
We haven’t done anything towards it
Exactly
It would be better if we all had the *same* curse imo <This message was edited>
Maybe
I think the uniqueness is fine
But also timescale hello?
How were we all cursed again?
From childbirth yeah?
Its not clear
How tf does that work
Well it should be
We found a book that dictated the time and place we were cursed
no he told us
But none of us remember apparently
we were all cursed at the same time
Weird
ish
Ohh ok then
she was experimenting with her powers at random
But albus is 100s of years old
That makes more sense
Maybe 1000s
As is the sister
although i don’t remember how the sister was introduced to the group
So she just got clowned on in her 800s
Tavern dwelling
It wasn't much if i remember
the sister would NOT tavern dwell
Apparently so
Nor would we randomly feel the same aura and decide “yeah I’ll dedicate my foreseeable future to helping these guys”
And honu wouldn't cower  and let his friends doe
Die*
Speak for yourself
Lucius got assigned to y’all for apparently being useless
Or sm like that
Relateability ig?
None of the introductions have been all that character appropriate
Accept for albus
Rip my man
Died how he was introduced
Doing awesome shit before getting absolutely crushed
Bro appeared?
In a dream
Riding a dragon
Watch him disappear from memory now too
NOO 😭😭😭
A man we’ve only seen in our dreams
STOP 😭😭
Honu has enough memory problems as it is mann
Its such a ben thing to do tho
Fourth man syndrome for the group
😭
LMAO YEA
Ngl I’ve kinda just ignored my curse beyond Jack taking care of my money for me
Right could someone give me any important cliff notes for the last 450 something messages that happened while I was busy
Is anyone planning anything
Weekly game nights at the Stothards, Friday nights, idea of group cooking for it
What to bring
Undecided yet
And it has been decided who my gf officially thinks I’m dating in this group (she’s taking the women)
Cooking type shi or baking type shi
😛😛
Yall poly?
I’m considering it, but she means more in the sense of the multiple wives you have
Ahh
Besides, I definitely haven’t asked the people she says I’m dating
You should ong
Nah, it included both Stothard’s
For the shiggles
I’ll let you keep your man
For now
For now???
This like split custody??
Ig you could come with if you wantef
But then I’d be splitting you w my gf <This message was edited>
True
Im at a Halloween party chat
They're so cute
(Im stealing one)
LNAOOO
Cosplay idea?@Dakota
Can yall decorate?
Yes
If you can get a glove looking like that, I can probably put it on the hand
Dnd, cyberpunk, poker. Also are people gonna be drinking
Bet
I was gonna suggest making a glove like it
Yes to any of the above or no to all
Stan had decisioned us to a max 2 pints each
No to all but poker
Except for two pints
Not rowdy drinking
Tbf I'll probably buy some mocktails
Calm and layed back
Maybe a bit, I think the intention was closer to board games and such
Alcohol free would be preferred on request of the host
Yup
Get drunk on some shloer 😛😛
Might make meals as a group (anything from stew to steal, feel free to make suggestions)
Yeah I can sacrifice some Pepsi cherries
Getting drunk is not allowed
And strictly dis encouraged <This message was edited>
Shloer is fully non alcoholic, it’s basically just fizzy grape juice
(I think)
Bro
Yes
what happened to the 2 pint rule
Its a Christmas drink
You can have two pints
SOJNDS AWESOMW
EXACTLYYYYY
But drunken disorderly behaviour is strictly forbidden
We might do some of those but we’re more talking actual board games
yep sounds fair enough
yur
If ya drink then be responsible
Combine every edition of monopoly we own as a group to make the whole country, not just london
No offence to anyone but I will pass
how come
That is your right
On the game nights as a whole
It is intended as a reoccurring event, so your free to drop in and out as needed
On a bi weekly happening
Before dnd every friday
As parents are going to be hosting there friends on the other friday
Even split yk
Aye fair nuff
But yeah just a wholesome mealtime with boardgames
Maybe finished with group anime binging
Not a function, calm music and little drinking, just a wholesome hangout ong
I have had an idea (unlikely), sleepover and rock up to dnd as a group in the morning
Functions is a spectrum
That's the plan bro
We all on the spectrum
Balling 😛
Those who want to sleepover can
You'll have to cuddle the homies goodnight tho obvs
Ah I see, I thought it was a start early, end early kinda thing
Squad cuddle puddle?
Frr
Including stan
Nah start late end late kinda thing, so everyone can come
And i get the bed to myself
All must join, including you if you there
What
But
But the double bed
Where do you think the pile gonna be? The floor?
Yes
EYYYY
we don’t have to drink tbf
2 pints ain’t gonna do shit anyways
Frr
Then don’t
Mocktails
That’s cool
EYYYY
😛😛😛😛
Ypu can just drink to enjoy the drink
ARRIVA FAMILY TICKETS
EXACTLY
7 squid for all to coalville
I think?
no drink is nice enough for that shi
YAAAA
Man idkts, I just cripple on for free
Fair nuff
Mannn
@Jack Payne @James  pull up bi weekly
Also @ceylan what time do you think you could reasonably get to ours btw?
ts friday ?
hmmm
Yeah sadly
Its the only day most of us are free
i go to my dads at 6 and am usually there until 10
We can start late and end late
Its chill
yeah i don’t mind missing a little
i could be there for 9.30
WARHAMMER
PAINTING RAAAAAHHHH
WARHAMMER
WE CAN DO WARHAMMER
PAINTING RAHHH
Holup I can’t stay over this Friday, I got poppy collecting before dnd
Hell yeah
Ay thats fair
Probably fine to hang on the Friday evening a bit tho
Real questions
A. What meal do y'all want
B. Whos coming
C. What boardgame do we play?
Cuz me and stan can cook beforehand
I’m home all friday so now i’m the chef, driver, organiser, medic and sober therapist
Anyone wanna take some of the load 🫩
wait i could probably arrange to see my dad on a thursday every two weeks instead
AAYYYYY
Ngl the sausage thing we had for rivers birthday was great so I wouldn’t mind that again, but also consider, Pasta of some variety
Skål!🍻
Yeah we'll make sumn nice
Maybe fondue at a later date?
Seeing as the lactose intolerant are finally gaining the dlc
I’m thinking something we can make en masse so everyone can get their appropriate fill
Chilli sound good?
Not spicy at all btw
Something pasta/rice based would be a safe bet probably then
YEAAA
yurp
although i don’t like tomato pasta stuff unfortunately
pasta isn’t something i’m awfully fond of
Hmm
Gotta get the carbs for the all night binging
Rice it is them
Then*
potato ladies
where the potato hype
Depends on the form, really not a fan of mash
Perish
Jackets are just superior
Chips
Stir fry?
Crisps (some)
Good shout
Aye sounds good
Well make a side dish as well
Sumn light
Stir fry requires sides of like spring rolls, prawn crackers and such
Spring roll are fucking peak
Can try
Shall we start by getting a whole document of group allergies and their severity?
Aye good shout
Good idea
Message either me and stan for your allergies
No allergies here, just picky
_*microsoft form_*
Bro really needs the family sponsorship deal
Nuh uh

Where?
Idk the only place I know with half a night life is Coalville

Perchance
Why?

I have another that’s like 300 something
But that one is firstly not in chronological order
And secondly I decided I needed a shorter playlist
Also it shows how my taste in music slowly changed over the last 5/6 years
And I think that’s pretty cool

Mmno
yer bird applied for 3 apprenticeships ✌️😖
there’s two great demons waging war inside of me chat
one demands i stay in college despite my misery and do a career that could make me miserable and the other demands i leave
What would leaving get you?
out of childcare and bitch class bro
So less cons, but any pros?
What would you do other than childcare
no university
If leaving puts you in a place to get qualifications, all good, but finishing college at least gives you something to build from if not
which is something i cannot decide if im willing to accept
something admin like
true but i have work experience from all this and i don’t wanna be depressed anymore icl
It's ok to change your mind fr
thank you my bro
If you think you can manage to survive long enough to finish, then majority of uni courses just need a college education, no specific course
yes yes
But that’s only if your committed to uni
but am i just wanting to do uni for the social life
which is what i think im looking for
If not, go for something else then
but i can just replicate this by going to clubs anyways
But I’ll tell you what makes things seem better
It’s late, go eep
u might be right
Eepy times, tell us if it’s better in the morning
shall do my bro
Ig the decision boils down to this, if you leave now you'll have only your GCSE qualifications and your childcare WE for any job you apply to, limiting any further income and leaving you with very few options later in life, making it harder to rise to any position that could make you comfortable in life (happiness is subjective), so the short term benefits of dropping out are great. But if you can hold out for some 6 months you'll leave with a very good T level qualification. Which immediately makes you more employable in most jobs, as it shows you have the resilience and the brains to get through FE which surprisingly most don't. After FE you have a whole year to decide if you go to uni or if regular work is for you, or you could even apply to uni at a later date. Point im making is if you drop out now you'll limit yourself for the rest of your life and you'll have to put so much more effort into going further, if you hold out for the 6 months, you prove to any employer that you are more accomplished than others, you don't have to go to Uni immediately after, you can go at any time, but you can never redo FE. That's what i see anyhow, Though i would urge that if you are feeling unable to continue your FE, please talk to one of the college mental health folk, they are great at keeping you going through hard times. Idk what your going through, but ik we all believe you can do this <This message was edited>
Sorry thats a lot
Ive had the talk on dropping out so many times now
Ive turned into my fucking dad 🫩
Tldr: short term pain now. Or long tem pain later
Or rather: short term pain now=more money after you finish
thank you bro
genuine
No probs
true but there’s also stuff like i’m not even sure i wanna actually work on education or anything yk
Always here to push you all to the best
Then you dont have to
You can finish FE and do regular work
Completely fine
At the end of the day a lot of employers ask for level three qualifications, never one in specific
Exactly
Its largely about proving resilience and commitment than actual knowledge
Just having any makes you atleast more employable than 60% of the population
Chat how the actual FUCK did i get a pimple on the bottom of my ear
Tf is ts
Idk bro
But yeah me and stan have had this talk many times
Mb cuh

Gang I’m getting rage baited by this fuckass time trial
I missed the time by 4 fucking hundredths of a second
And I cannot catch that shit
I am not consistent enough

Literally the stars have to align to get through it at full throttle
I’m gonna crash out
No

Fucketh me
Hit 1:32:281
EYYYYY
Needed 32:5
BIG UPS
Drove around 200 kilometres of track to get there
Fucking hell
Yeah
I’m now down for silver in 8 days time
The time for bronze was 42:5
And I shattered that on my first run with a 35
And thought “hmm I can probably find around 3 seconds”
And I did
Yippee <This message was edited>
Yippeee ✨✨✨
Just discovered that the target times are relative to the world record
Gold is within 3%, silver is 5% and bronze is 20%
I’d need to find another 1.7 seconds to hit gold
I don’t even know where I’d find that much time tbh
Stans coming today folks
Yippee!
Sorry what’s happening
Boy be bussin
Nth bro its all good
Stan that fucking woman may have fucked over a lot of students
Also happy winterfylleþ!
Thus comes the winter

Bet
Oh no
HEHEHE
Prepare

All embrace me
what’s this friday anyway
what we doijg
Board game
Not sure what kind
But we'll play one
Do we play a premade dnd adventure so that river can learn the game before hand?
EYYY THATD BE COOL
I have loads of premade short adventures
Hell yeah
2/3 hour session, some poker n shit , monopoly anime OH EYAAA
that sounds like the dream
Ughhhh
Utter peak
This is like literal found family type shi
Damn now I’m super sad I can’t stay over this time
Can you not 🥺
How will you get home?
Yeah I’ve got poppy collecting before dnd
Good question
Ohhh
When would you leave?
If we ask very nicely im sure one of our parents cpuld take you home?
Stan do you have a battle map btw?
Wait nvm i can print one off
That would be most appreciated, I’d be wanting to be home like 10 at latest
Easily done then
Wonderful
I wouldn’t make promises will
I’m pretty sure mum and dad are going out
Shi yeah
Oh wow the buses stop earlier than I thought
Yeah last one is 5
It’s starting at 7, yeah?
Yuh
Wait @ceylan are you getting bus to ours or getting driven? <This message was edited>
If somebody can’t drive me back, I probably won’t come unfortunately
We'll ask our parents tonight
What time they get back
And if they could
If not we'll try and fund you an über
Perhaps

Can i bring my barbarian?
What level?
Wait when is it sorry
(10th please)
Ill give you all specs soon
Friday
Were doing this for river who's never played, so not a fucking chance
It’ll be fine
Its meant to be fun for the whole group too
Its gonna be 5th
And it will be
We’ve been playing low level characters for ages
Um stan yeah
God forbid i want some feats
I’m going though character creation with her this afternoon
Im DMing so let do as i fucking please yeah?
Sorry
You couldn’t seem to get that
Don't start this now
She’s getting thrown into ninth level the next day so wouldn’t using the same character for both help her?
Don’t wanna mix things up
Point is there easy to DM for
This Friday?
So lets ease her in with less yeah?
Yes
Can I play some dnd
Indeed
Everyone can
Wouldn’t new features in an actual environment be more stressful than having them all explained in a friendlier one
Was gonna start her out in fighter so features are minimal anyway
Stan 🫩 it would be considerably easier for her to understand less originally and understand more later
Dakota pinned a message
Steps yk
Either way
The adventure is rated at certain level
And im not budging bro
She isn’t gonna get them proper explained on Saturday
I’d rather not have it slow my session
Stan she'd have at best 3  extra features explained
Would still be better learnt casually rather than in a session intended to have a serious tone
She'll understand just fine stan
Idk what your still arguing for
Alternatively, you could run her through it in other downtime between/aroind?
Like on the bus?
She could just read the books?
Or during the binge
Point is
I aint budging
If im gonna run a small 3 hour session
I dont wanna spend an hour of it explaining stuff
Anyhow
@James you coming then?
Will check your messages
Ye I’ll ask
Chur
Bro why were you guys arguing

What did you think we were referring to?
No offence, just curious
Hill climber 1 is still peak, 2 was alright
I concur
Opinions on the build-your-own garage?
Thought new thing was planned forgot about Friday night plans
Nay
Friday is the only free day we all have
Right what is the plan for drinking
There isnt one?
There isn't any drinking
Only non alcoholic things
Its jus wholesome vibes
Fr
I will see if I can come if drinking is off
And if there is alcohol its a singular pint for the entire evening
But even thats unlikely
Like when ppl have a drink with dinner kinda thing?
Exactly
Drinking isn’t entirely off, some people still want too
Some people is me
But that's cuz i like a pint w my tea
Drinking will be minimal
There wont be any consistent drinking
May have a jack and coke to warm the spirits
There is no plan to become pissed
Nor will alcohol bw bought fpr the occasion
If people what to drink that’s fine but it’s if It turns into the full party thing that happened last time
It wont
We are hoping for a family evening kind of thing
Calm to a point
Enjoying each others company
What timr
Time
7 til whenever
In person today we’ve been describing it as a found family kinda thing
Start
Plan is for most to sleep over

I need to try that
I need diet professor peppy and vodka
Also seen, calpol flavour Smirnoff
So literal cough syrup
Well it would certainly fix any problems in your throat
Kill or cure
James you good bro?
Merely a point of view
Nah I’m just bored😂
Bro
So started playing with the buttons
Go burn sumn
Ain’t got nth to burn
I just did, scouts was fun
Chat it ain’t letting me vote again😂
HA
Becca kept blowing out my tip
Context.
Oop your gf wont be happy bout thag
HUH
Long thin marshmallows on a stick, burned
Dw, I blew hers out too
Wouldn’t it be blowing on then?
Out makes no sense
No cuz one is indistinguishable from giving head
I know
And that is quite important
But out doesn’t make sense
There was also a couple with us, all four of us were blowing each others tips
Or just “blowing my tip” would work
I think even dakota has standards
Nvm🫩
That’s also grammatically correct
But “blowing out” doesn’t work
I told them no, but the dude was insistent about blowing my tip
Pick your words buddy
And calling me Damian <This message was edited>
Dw, the couples ace
stan when i get you
Lemme guess
67?
yes
Dya want river or me to smack him for ya?
And yet he threatens to leave it bc I send it him

What do the attendees want for desert tmr?
Shall one of us bake a tart?
Me and river were considering making an apple crumble but would like more input
We wanna bake but also make sm everyone wants
I fw both of those
Im not partial to apple pie icl
Tarts though, a tin of assorted tarts 🤤
Different fruits yk
Exactamundo
It’s lookin like I probably won’t be there, but I’m suggesting cinnamon rolls/buns
Why not?
WAIT I FORGOT
dakota our parents can take you home at 10 dw
Brownies
BROWNIES
WITH WEEEEEEDD

Boring
But fair
Just this time

Just for funzies
Sybau

Ik ik
Says the fucking smoker
Hypocritical .much
Will you know for a fact smoking and weed is a whole different debacle
Also i dont smoke anymore
How so
Well possession of one is technically criminal
Right...
It’s not the finest idea for me cuz I know I can get addicted to shit very easily
Fine ill drop it
Same icl
Like with the pop tarts on Sunday?
Ate one
Then finished off all 6
Also how can someone so adamant against normal cigarettes be so into weed?
If you don’t know how should we?
You live with him
That’s why we don’t possess for long, we dispose of evidence by fire
Good question
So stir fry, brownies what we having for a side?
Bitch what
Apple slices
I forgor, my maths teacher has decided on his punishment for “6-7”. You are required to present a 67 word essay on the meaning of 6-7 at the start of the next lesson.
Ooh that should be fun
Indeed
We’re getting one on Monday
Thats a snack not a fucking dish
And then the class decides if further punishment is necessary
Cinnamon apples
What is it with you and cinnamon
Also we cant
Ceylan hates cinnamon
He likes cinnamon
Cinnamon is banging
I agree
I also like cinnamon
But ceylan doesn’t like it so we aren’t having it
But lets not exclude a friend from a dish
Oh yeah
You get my point
I do
Do we need a side?
Yes
Or can we just buy scran
What are side dishes to yall?
Every meal needs a side dish
Something light
To compliment the meal
Honestly I don’t mind if we have one or not
@ceylan imme beef w yo over cinnamon
Guess ill make it then
Cucumber salad?
Cucumber is great
Doesnt haveto be spicy
Or make one spicy one not spicy
Icl as someone who hates cucumber, I’d eat that
Heyll yeah
But if it’s a side to the stir fry, I’m once again putting spring rolls and/or prawn crackers up for consideration
I can confirm it's nice
Prawn toast required
Thems the rules
This is specifically in a section for stir fry side dishes btw
Gotta have it
What's prawn toast
And lime quarts to be squeezed
😮
🤯
Yuh thats peak
Never tried it, but I’d be willing to
Ill get it done
His will be done 🥺✨✨🇸🇪🇸🇪
Nutting
This
Just want to note that we have to pay for and make all of this
That is a good point that I had not considered
Ooh
Ive came to this so many times
Good point, I can give one of you £20 cash Friday some point to help
We cannot stack too much, since we have to balance working time and cost
Yuh
Lets stick to mains and dessert
I think it’ll be filling enough
Nah the cucumber thing ill do
Nuh uh
Prawn toast is pretty easy, just stick it in the oven
You’re probably right
We'll divvy up work later dw
Aight
If we can help, feel free to give us tasks oh great quest-givers
😛
me the night i threw up
Personally I think dessert will be the hardest part and it's still pretty simple
Alright if me and river work on dessert , oscar and will make the main
thanks queen
Ceylan and dakota can make the sides
Should I print off recipies or something
Yea
Yuh if you could
Sides was the cucumber salad, right?
Yup
I like printers
Brrr
Yup
real
Stir fry, spicy (not very dw) cucumber salad, and brownies
Sounds good chat?
This sounds splendiferous icl
Indeedamus
Awesome
River, I’ll let you lead on the salad and I’ll follow directions
Your w ceylan mate
Oh shi yea I misread
How
Literally how
I’m making lunch rn
We’ll get the dessert in the oven alongside the stir fry so its done after dinner
Sick
I luv you guys icl
?
Love you guys too
Not in a polyamoury way dw
Why is the stir fry going in the oven?
YESSSS
I value you all above other and similarly roled humans
Did I just misunderstand it?
It isn’t, i’m saying the brown shall bake while the stir fry is finished and consumed
No we'll cook them at the same time
Noooo
yeah man
i will vomit everywhere
WAZZAA 😝
Ok cool
I was really confused for a sec
Chat i gotta lock in so ill catch you all in a bit
i’ll kill u
Ok see you later dude
i hate cucumber sorry x
Armed combat
So do i
busted
Broccoli?
came
😛
But that shit looks delumptious
Shall we do broccoli instead then
No
No thanks
huh
Sorry ceylan
Broccoli is much worse than cucumber
You got assigned a role
Gotta tske one for the team this time
Your being put to w*rk
Watch your mouth
No
It is
I love both
THEYRE SEXY
I will die on that hill
TF YOU MEAN
THEYRE SO MMMMMMM
CHAT ITS A FUCKING VEGETABLE CALM DOWN
I don’t like either but I specifically hate broccoli with a passion
And as I said the cucumber side looks fine as fuck
Chat this is why i’d say cut the sides, the more foods you add the lower the chances of coming to a consensus
broccoli  sexy
STOP FUCKING THE VEGETABLES
okay’
!
I believe we reached a consensus?
True
That’s Ceylan’s role
Also true
thanks for censoring
WHAT ARE WE MAKING
exactly
But Ceylan is wrong, so something else
LOCK IN
Stir fry, cucumber side and brownies
also if me and dakota are making sides can we decide what (as long as everyone else fw it)
That’s what’s being made to my knowledge
why cucumber…
Sorry i think we're all down for this
Cuz its sumptuous
Also sorry, I don’t like brownies, I’m fine with them being made and other people having them, I’d just not eat it
Moist
We’re deciding as a group
Tender almost
As a...
It’s like water with seeds in it, it’s lovely
Do not
i like cucumber 3/10 times
Same
sometimes it’s heavenly divine
and sometimes it taste like fucking shit and i don’t know why
But I think this falls into that 3/10
sometimes it just has a horrible aftertaste
This shouldn't taste too much like cucumber
Hence the use of spices
Can we PLEASE just look for solutions over just saying what we do and don’t like over and over
either way
i feel like we look for something we all like
If you have the time
sides suggestion - garlic bread
Dumplings <This message was edited>
i always have garlic bread with stir fry
S*
garlic bread takes 15 mins in oven
Any opposition to prawn crackers/toast?
No thanks, dad throws up at the smell of garlic
Its also bland asf
Great, but I think a bit too time consuming
Yuh
Prawn toast?
Yes
All in favour?
I think everyone seems to like it
Yuh
Any objections to prawn toast?
bland ???
Speak now or forever hold your peace
Depends
Can be

In terms of road space to vehicle ratio

I don’t want to be the only one turning up in a suit
I’m not
But I do want to turn up in a suit
Idk who else is
If I remember correctly it was just you and Leo
But just wanted to confirm
I was not planning on dressing up, I don’t have anything with dressing up in
I can go sleeveless again for Johnny if needs be
i COULD dress up if you wish
but only if i get earlier bus
because if not i won’t have time
I must hear from the other stothard first
Hm?
Oh dressing up
Uhh could do?
But probably gonna remain casual
Ok casual it is
Bro
If you want to wear a suit I promise you I will dress tf up

Btw I’m gonna ask two questions now:

Drg

Seance
What
seance dog ?
gang i’ve lowkey had a sore throat all week and my body has decided that by friday instead of getting better it’s gonna get worse so i’m gonna have to put out a current warning that i may not be able to come <This message was edited>
but i probs will! i’ll let yall know
Oh dang hope you survive
thanks brotha
You can only have two pints
The pints:
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdwAyRem/
Maybe and no
And those aren’t questions
Those are words
Not everyone can play drg at once so also probably no
A seance isn't a decision on a whim either, you gotta think thru it and buy proper equipment
Yeah we're not performers
It's not like an exorcism where you just ask a guy and we turn up
I feel like it also stretches the meaning  of casual?
Idk how many casual hangouts have seances
Fr
K
GUYS
DEPOSIT IS DOWN ON TATTOO
WHOO HOO

When did they get tables in the workshop?
Same thing
Ages ago like since I came here
Damn
Table having mf
The joke was that I don’t go to a college Stan
We get given free toecaps
When i first joined the corps we had sticks, two sticks and a rock for the whole platoon. AND WE HAD TO SHARE THE ROCK
Mann i had to pay for mine
They let you keep them even tho you only go in the workshop first year
Peak

Bros

But the pjs comfy asf

Go to that meeting
Meet in the PJs?
What's the dresscode today
Regular
Its a CASUAL event
FINEE
Starting to sound like a cultist
ILL PUT THE GOWN DOWNN
Alr
BRING THR GOWNNN
I’m wearing cargos and a college jumper like usual
Cus comfort clothes ong
Mhm
I'll wear mine then
I shall be turning up as I have to college, fully accessorised
@ceylan Charlie has requested I steal your dick for her, what should I tell her
Its too big to mail
11 min till the meeting
Nah, at the games tonight
Still in pjs
If the point of this is found family, does that mean its finally…
OUR ZIGGY
OUR ZIGGY!
Get dressed girl
OUR ZIGGY!
I DONT WANNAAAAA
IT FEELS GOOD ON MY SKIN
Oh yes if I tell her about ziggy, she will request I steal the cat too
Go go go go
PEEL OFF YOUR SKIN
Put clothes over the pjs?
OUR ZIGGY
Fair
OUR ZIGGY
OUR ZIGGY
But then the penits come out
OUR ZIGGY
OUR ZIGGY
OUR ZIGGY
Ok so as a found family we are stealing ziggy, and my gf still wants Ceylan’s cock
Correct
Perfekt
Would Ziggy go from house to house or stay at th major gathering place (the Stothard’s)?
We’ll take turns
Stan and Will will share a turn, being in the same house
Nah
We’re separate people
We deserve a turn each
But Stan you basically get another half a turn at rivers too
Nah its more like she takes half of mine
Shes here more than i’m there
Damn so river doesn’t get a turn, but the Stothards get two weeks
Yeah that checks out
Yk what i should just get him
I deserve all the turns with him
Stan go do something productive, I’m supposed to be coding
Also my hand may or may not be haunted
I am being productive
How?
I’m making a rotation for our Ziggy
We gonna roll for turn order?
Get coding cuh
Yeah we’ll roll for iniative
Yes bc you refuse everytime I ask.
Kys
I wont want time w ziggy dw
(i'd die 😓)
Worth it tho
Fir the cuteness
So i get three turns now?
Nuh uh
NO
You get ONE
And i get ONE
One?
Nah j think i deserve three <This message was edited>
No you dont absorb my turn stanley 🫩
You get 1
Why not
Think of the logistical savings
Cuz its my turn
Don’t need to worry about moving him if he’s always here
And i dont want it
Therefore my turn is removed from the equation
Increasing the time he would be at people's houses
How about weekend visitation?
Except he's not gonna be at our house bro 😭
Why not 😭
Cuz its not our cat that's why
Bro wants that puss
It is *OUR ZIGGY* now
Sybau cuh
He maybe very cute
But he aint ours

Love it
It’s great when it snows, but parade uniform is not made for warmth
Well thats a bit stupid innit
Why not just have one uniform thats warm
We’re allowed our jumpers in winter, but they don’t do too much for being woollen
Because when the summer comes we all cook to death
And nearly all parades are late in the year too
Also did you know that this year Coalville clock tower is 100 yrs old
I did
Yes i did
There was a sign and everything
Indeed
Gang if we’re doing Italian for the next game night can we dress up?

And is any of your stuff from those?
a lot is smaller sellers

i think the only things that weren’t were the ear stretching stuff and the wings!
i just had to get the ear things adam got cos he lost the bigger ones so i’m stuck at 6mm rn
boy listen boy
i have £70 free from my collective savings
Uh huh

yipee!
Car?
License
Driving lessons cuh
do not say those words to me.
Well if you don’t want a *job* you should use your trust fund money in them
letting yall know
saturday general is sold out
only priority remains
and my mother cannot take me sunday nor friday
so i’ll probs get priority 💔
Oh no we’ll *have* to get priority tickets
The horror

Driving license

my bank account just witnessed so much horror
£100 just left my vank
mother covered £20 of my costume stuff
I think you’re cooked
i also think so
back down to a whopping £20
until further notice
Whats self control
i can’t spend anything until comic con
otherwise i won’t have a single penny spending money
last year at comic con i spent like 80£
£30 of that shit on dice
and like the rest on funko pops and art
🫩
You have a problem
i have like £20 cash, £20 in bank, and i’ll have gained like £40 in pocket money by then so i think ill be alreet
nuh uh
I’ll hopefully have sold more shit so i’ll be up £300
eyyyy
mint tbh
i may jump on the bandwagon
sell some of my old manga perhaps
Good idea
If I’m going, I’ll bring my Nepal backpack to carry stuff (90 litres)
so what’s everyone going as ?
We’re going to a con not the icewind dale
Lucius maybe
But I can carry the groups stuff, then I don’t necessarily need a costume
Go as the pack rat from inscryption
eyyy
bro😭😭😭
LMAO
Hol up gang
We may be able to get at least a couple people in free
Carers tickets
Put them in the backpack
That’s at least one person in free with me
That too
LMAO

god forbid a girl feel whimsy
For lucius do i wear a turtleneck or dress shirt

tbf
Yeah me too

Turtleneck, cargo trousers, harness of weapons and trenchcoat
Thats the fit
Combat boots to
dressed like this
yesss
Throw in a turtleneck with rolled sleeves and thats basically it
That’s what a turtleneck is?
No thats a combat shirt
yurppp
although it’s giving very
non fantasy
I always thought turtlenecks were the ones with like super long necks rolled over
how can we fantasy this shit ip
Our setting is hybrid fantasy
ah right
But the answer is leather equipment belts and throwing knives
yurppp
Leather padding
a lighter would be in character
The lord and saviour *_darktide_* hath graced me with inspiration
Smokes cigarettes obviously
But only when stressed
eyyyy

T’au fireteams are combat polycules. <This message was edited>
Oh?
What a horrible day to read
Brothers ears perked up real quick
You know i’m right
I dont sorry
What?
They literally have a bonding ceremony where they cut themselves with the same knife to mix their blood together
Battle buddies to the next level
Thats kinda cool icl
This is the only concept of marriage within their culture.
(I don’t know what a polycule is)
Bonded to battle and the fight
Brothers in arms
(A partnership involving multiple people)
Ok thanks
Not always in combat
All the castes use this ceremony
But you said fireteams
So yes
Combat
The shas’ui carries ‘the’ bonding knife while the rest of the squad get replicas
I said not always combat
Technically all tau are in some form of bonded ritual
Literally said combat polycules
Though the bonded groups vary in size
As a starter for the joke
Now extending the lore cus its interesting
Ahh got ya
Dw eldar take it to a whole new and freaky level
Ofc they do
Orks dont have this
Cuz why would one need to complicate life w thinking
When you can just fight
For *SOME UNKNOWN REASON* eldar pregnancies require multiple dna submissions
That’s crazy
Put in worse context, they gotta shag like 4 times to have a child
Hmm tbf, it could have something to do with their gametes
Less chromosomes per male gamete
Meaning an eldar child can have 4 dads and be 100% related to all of them
Oh I thought you meant they need an orgy
Not *need* but it isn’t uncommon
Ok
Slaanesh exists for a reason ig
Separate to how they reproduce tho
Thank you for attending my ted talk
(they was just horny)
What
Warhammer
Space elves
Fucking a god into existence
Next week, krieg reproduction? Test tube legions or nuclear horrors?
Sounds like ppl tbf
dude i fw warhammer lore bro
Its so juicy
Its so great right?
why is it the coolest people are always evil sex people tho
drukhari💔💔💔💔
Umm orks?
Any faction has an interesting degree of lore
Literally better in every conceivable way
(not biased)
sure 🤨🤨
Like votann being ai generated people based on several sets of dna
Or chaos demons being literal nightmares made manifest in the warp
Orks are genderless symbiots of 2 fungi like beings
fire asf
once i get enough drukhari to get my army im switching straight up
Orks improve what they are good at the more orks are in proximity to each other
i’m not loyal
i just want cool armies
How big is an army to you?
Out of curiousity
Valid
The death korps are a bunch of vat grown teenagers brainwashed into shaming themselves for actions committed 1.5 thousand years before their birth
💕colonel jurten 💕
Valid
The largest ork in existence, was a constant threat to humanity to the point kf nearly dethroning holy terra as humanities seat of power
They what
They are 2 fungi
That bind together to make a humanoid
Seeing as there reproduction is spore based
Orks have no concept of gender or sex
As it does not assist fighting
Mannn fuck octarius, bullshit win ong
You fucked around
You found out
Still nuked it
Still won
Common ork w
Well depends how you looked at it
They’re made of shrooms, no wonder literally everything about them is belief powered
Humanity is still fighting leviathan yes?
Its hunger has not been satiated yes?
That's different
And its not that its belief powered
More that
We prevented the orks from getting some bombs capable of making world’s unliveable
Everyone is
Physics to orks is based off of a schrodingers perspective
There understanding dictates how they interact with the world
By destroying the planet?
Nah just one city
Doesn't that defeat the point
Then we nuked the planet
Also we lost one world to protect many more
Wait so two entities, is that like half and half or like egg type stuff?
Statistical win
The cogitators said so
Hasnt leviathan destroyed countless worlds
I’m not seeing your argument?
What does leviathan have to do with octarius
Leviathan won that conflict
You destroyed octarius to prevent orks destroying worlds
enough points to play
But leviathan ( a result of the octarius war) is destroying countless worlds
2k right now?
Sick 1000 points
right *
oh mint
It’s less about the orks themselves and more about the weapons of mass destruction they could have gained
Sorry?
2k games are most common
I divvent understand
True but the cheaper method is 1k
Because ceylan always makes the financially correct decision 🙄
hey..
what’s this supposed to mean…
i invest in my material and short term happiness okay
Why do you reply to the message when your message is the direct next in the chat?
It would make sense either way
And what about the long term?
sybau
Anyhow
You suck at self control and financial responsibility
1k yeah?
Chat I’m fucking ill
and also i feel like wahammer has lowkey has had a slight positive affect on my confidence cos ive proved to myself i can literally make something and it be cool so who gaf
worth the money
what
Mental health ong
literally not ttue
bc everything i need to spend i have
Slay
i only spend money that is spare boy
Mhmm

Dont even lad
/J btw
Gotta be clear
i will literally throw you out of the top window /srs😝😝😝
joking btw guys please dont report me
Anyhow 🫩
Anyhow
Warhammer lore is interesting and we should play the ttrpg (not desperate btw)
guys don’t you just hate when winter hits then the childhood eczema you thought had left comes back swinging <This message was edited>
YESSS
yesss
once i have enough i very much will
i’m very determined to
No i luv winter
Well done
Don’t need models for the ttrpg
yeah i love winter too  but not the itchy and dry skin i gain
BOSH
But the main game we should defo play
me too bro😖😖
Please i beg 😭😭😭😭
Game night activities?
what
wym?
You can all just fight me at once please i just wamt a gamd
Table Top Role Playing Game
Ttrpg
Dnd is a ttrpg
Cyberpunk too
And warhammer has one now
Two even
yeah i know what it means but i didn’t know there was a version for it
Yurp
what’s it like
Grim
And dark
Gothic cyberpunk is the best way i can put it
And theres 40000 warhammefs
D6 system
Let’s paint first
Bet
Many more defined rules compared to dnd tho
that’s actually so fire
Omg sewing badges onto jackets and such too
why haven’t we played it by now
Broke
💔
If you have a question on how something specific is done then there is a rule for it (instead of making it the dms problem)
As the warhammer lore nerd i volunteer as tribute to dm sometime
Sacrifice him
YES PLSSS
But also please can we play regular warhammer 😭😭😭😭
DO IT BOY
OH BENEFICENT EMPEROR TAKE MY SOUL AS TRIBUTE TO YOUR DIVINE MACHINATIONS
Yes
And yes
YIPPEEEE
Just lemme buy and paint some Krieg
Wait who’s got purity seals
I will buy some seals for my various devices
My hand
Lying on the paint half
/*
J*
Ffs
No typing?
Yes 🫩
i need to finish mine i’m so desperate
once i’ve got my assignments n stuff done im so back
nov 25th i’m free
How much have you got?
Models wisd
Cuz my guess is your at around 470 points including your xmas stuff
i’m currenky just calculating my shi
Right got it
You have the app?
There’s an app for that?
Yuh
Helps keep the game balanced
At a quicker pace
Rather than waiting nearly 3 years for a new codex
It also helps keep all the datasheets n order
okay cool so by the time i get my new stuff i’ll have 770 points!
that’s pretty mint
Bosh
All you gotta do now is buy the drukhari book as well
And you can play!
i currently have 510
what the fuckery bro
what
i have
i have to BUY MORE???
Codex
TO PLAY???
WHAT???
WHY EVER
30squid
Rules arw not free
WHAT
GW is homosexual
In a bad way
Greedy fucks
Worst part is the book becomes invalid after 2 months
The rules inside are out of date
dude what the actual fuck what the fucker this is vile what the fuc
WHAT
ONG??
You buy it once get acces to the app rules
And abandon the book
Yep
Its cringe
But its also a lore book as well
This is why I say dnd is superior
So there's that ig
Not comparable sadly
Wargame vs ttrpg
Darn
But its all good
forever ?
Pretty much
The one point I will concede warhammer is far superior is the painted models those things are sick
Until the start a new edition in a few years
Then you have to wait til yoyr factions book gets re released
Buy it again
And abandon it again
I have several books
okok
this is crazy
All of which are invalid
money grabbing fucks
Yurp
This is why i valye my discount sm
when was it last updated
like changed completely
Recently
Last year
okah cool
when will it again
I think weve got 2 years
Stan .might correct me on that
jesus😭😭😭
why do they do this
*_MONEY*_
Rules and lore updates quote unquote
But also cus rules need updating
But yeah money
The ridiculous cost however is kinda insane
They are UK based tho
So economic leakage isnt happening thankfully
but why?
Balancing
Cyz shits unbalanced
Maintaining interest
The other space elves
Eldar
then make it balance in the first place i don’t get it
Are unbalanced asf
STILL
Also because making new editions is fun
Cuz its not that simple
The game is hella big
Why don’t we still play the first edition of dnd?
no ixea
Exactly
Balancing every interaction eith every rule takes forever
New editions were made to keep the game fresh and retain interest from the fanbase
Better to just rebalance later than wait a long ass time
GW is a small company as well
right
Also because many of the balancing decisions can only be made with lessons learned from official tournaments
Yeah
You don’t know how rules will interact when you write them
Precisely
There's hundreds of datasheets to write
But its mainly - balance, interest and money
Money is a big factor
A model making company has gotta make its dues
But the good news is that until you get a codex in a new edition, your rules are 100% free
Yurp
But sadly all codexes have released
Only took 2 years
So no luck for free drukhari fules
But its 30 squid
Well you can still get them, they just aren’t to date
No you cant
There are 0 free datasheets
Not on the app
Just download the pdf from the website
Ohh yeah
bro they get PLENTY from their overpriced ahh models
Or
Piracy
Model making is expensive
💔
.
warhammer40000_indexes_drukhari_eng_16.10.pdf • 57 pages document omitted
i seriously doubt its that expensive bro..
Its hella out of date
Widuwy right here
Boom done
But it works
Out of date but useable
FR?
Apparently so
USEABLE??
If you are really cheap
Yup
what will be different
Just not at tournaments
Most of the rules
Unbalanced
But we dont mind
I care about the fighting
eyyyyy
mint
And you only get 1 of the 6 detachments
Not how fair it is
i’ll get the codex eventually but i literally cannot afford 💔
what are tjese
(thats flavour of army)
Like how they fight
If we all used the same era of rules it’s be ok right?
No
(REINFORCEMENTS)
Ill stick w my balance
So you guys can have some fun atleast
No
Perish
It was based back at the start
Absolutely based
Based on literal aids
3 cp for a second chance
Whats not to love
Emperor protects
Anyhow
If you ever want a test game @ceylan just ask me or stan
Just will atmo
Since i have no models
Oh right
Or atleast no useable models
I’d be happy to watch if it was happening on a game night
Youve gotta have 500 points lying around still?
Nope
Damn
Not all in one army
Actually yes i do
ah
TWO ROGAL DORNS
520 points
i’m down whenever
One can be a commander
Technically a useable army
Albeit lacking anything
I’ll have 1200 points by the end of the year
Then i’ll build out my meta list after that
Sick
Whenever your good
waittt
am i supposed to pick a detachment ??
The training shall begin
No
okah good
You are sadly forced into one
Because you broke
😔
what’s this mean then
You only have access to the rules of one
But on the app it displays them all
would you pick one ordinarily
how does it affect gameplay
Its the like the subclass lf an army
Of*
From what I understand, it’s like only having one subclass
Yes
It affects your army rules and stratagems
Its basically special rules that typically favour a specific playstyl of fighting
*detachment rules
Mine allows me to do fast hit and run tactics
Siege regiment vs recon element to use some guard examples
right
Stans allow him to force longer ongoing conflcits
i may watch some videos tonight abt combat in general
Bring the boom
Best of luck
Watch 40k in 40 minutes
Its informative and interesting
Watch midwimter minis for a brief explanation
Like critical role
Then watch this
This first
They have a good 10E video to help explain the non army specific rules
okok
Actually
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmv1SRWyPfh85LBoX9JbB4-aKHxXYEWvo&si=dBEo0aaVi0BWyerm
This guy is class
Literally the jesus of warhammer
If you need to knos anything
And i mean anything
He has a long ass video on it
Even druhkari rules
yurp i shall watch

Who’s awake chat
sir yes sir
i still cannot really talk and the black death still remains but i’m painfully aware of the attendance meeting i had
where they told me i need to get my act together or leave
but i missed both placements this week too😭😭
i’ll have to catch those up during holidays
Alr sweet
Party on the 127
yurppp
Be prepared for it to be a lil crowded cus of the small 16 😭
they permanently made the 16 small????
Hope tf not it was crowded enough already
that’s what i’m saying
it wasn’t enough a sis
as the 127 has been far too busy on a wednesday ANYWYA
like what the fuck
Secured the booth chat
Hurry up
awesome almost there brk
@Dakota
Gang
What
Function/get together idea
Blind kareoke
Bike meet
So we're singing songs we sort of know by heart
Blind kareoke is your mates pick a song, they put the kareoke version on, and you have to sing without seeing what song it is
Sounds horrible
Lose the beat and crush a beer?
It’s usually slightly intoxicated and hilarious bc it goes wrong
It has to be a song the person knows
Or they'll be no singing
Yeah stuff within reason
Also stand ready for my arrival
Walkie talkie man
BET
Where is bro
FUVKING WATCH ME SMASH THAT OUT
That’s the streets of thringston if I have it rivbt
Nope
Shepshed
Ewwww
Ikr
Gross
That’s worse
I love maths
I created a general formula for any multidimensional graph
And how it would be represented in 2d as a series of graphs
This is what wizards be doing icl
YESSS
Yuhh
Real
Also binary square roots
🙁🙁
What?
I think it’s really fucking cool
Well make sure you get sleep token at least once, will gets sabaton or similar
Maths 😭
I ran away for a reason
Id love to understand it
We just stick literally any britpop on for Stan
I can try to help you
Idk how good I am at teaching <This message was edited>
Yeah gan man
Or punk rock
Im sure you'll do good
THE AUTISM PRESENTATIONS
We forgot them
YEAS
IMMA DO POLYDIMENTIONAL GRAPHS
YAYAYAY
Ong two minute talks
Nah
Mines gonna be more than 2 minutes buddy
Full on presentation
we should do powerpoint presentation nights this is what i’m saying
Ong
Proper uni lecture shit
i’d just lecture your ahh on tokyo ghoul or sleep token
Cool
I can do a full 20 minutes of sm none of you will understand <This message was edited>
Raising group intellect and culture
That’s the idea
Learn sm new
Perhaps yall haven’t heard of two minute talks, it’s not something you prepare for, you are given a topic and must talk for two minutes non stop about it (it doesn’t need to be true)
no.
nah
I did that at cadets once
Exactly
Talked about how the training sgt liked me (obvious lie)
Chat imma do psychology
But sm of us already do psychology 😞
yuh
In depth psychology
i love doing psychology
Same ong
it’s the best part of my course
I’m doing in depth psychology RIGHT NOW
What drives man to do things
Leave me alone
I have some options, but like it’s already stuff yall mostly know
The idea is that it’s on what you want
Why are humans tge way we are
Literally the focus of my course
We do allat
ours is how people learn and why they’re motivated to
but it’s like
similair
because it’s about drive and motivation
aswell as how children develop mindsets
and language
Why does man start conflict
and self comforts
concepts *
attachments
I do specifically behaviourism and conflict
ohhhh attachment theory is so good
BEHAVIOURISM
Its uniformed service after all
KEEP ME BADM
behaviourism is the best
can be applied to ANY 16 marker
any course work
anytning
because all you have to do is mention that you’ve praised the child
Maybe ill do history instead
Who knows
Am I the only Loughborough who doesn’t have an element of psyc?
No i dont either
Im just interested in it anyway
Well technically we do place attachment in geo
So if you want i could explain why people lool down on coalville and the NW of leicestershire
Look*
Oh that’d be cool
Or i v.could do globalisation
Could*
And how our actions echo around the world
My options are like dnd, neurospicy and alphabet mafia with the links between, or Hazbin
Skinner, bandura, pavlov and all the rest
What
Anyhow
We shall do that at some point yes?
Limit of 15 minutes people🫩
Perhaps closer to Christmas, when assignments are gone and done

Holy shitballs
The aura is insane
Interesting choice <This message was edited>
“So what weapons do you use?”
Gang
nah centipede and the skull!
HEHEHE
I just spent like 2 hours scrolling through alohaii’s discord
Cuz I found he keeps like unreleased songs and stuff on there
And I found some of the peakest shit I’ve ever heard in my life
Congrats
so what’s this supposed to mean bitch🙁
semi-auto honesty v3.wav document omitted
Utter peak
likes it but not cool enough to say it
he gotta be nonchalant
eyyyy
Now I just need to transfer them to my laptop so I can transfer them back to my phone so I can add them to spotify
Bosh
yurp
UNITED
And on my laptop I can add artists and cover art so it looks like it was actually released even if it wasnt
Means i personally wouldn’t get it but feel like it matches your personality and style
Im wheezing 😭
Oh god
Gaaaaang
I’m having a fucking aneurysm
So remember how I said I was trawling through alohaiis unreleased songs
They are all stored as .wav files
That is as lossless as it gets
And I wanted those on spotify
Problem: Spotify mobile can’t understand .wav files
But
It can understand .m4a files
These are not typically lossless but Apple did something cool for once and made them lossless with their alac encoding
So I can have lossless local audio on Spotify yippee
Next problem
I want cover art and other things so it isn’t just a placeholder image whenever I’m listening to it
So after installing a program specifically to convert my .wavs into .m4a (alac) and figuring out what bit depth each song had
I pulled all the .m4as into mp3tag to I can edit their metadata
This means I can specify what the song’s title is, who made it, when it was made and a few other things including cover art
I then spent like 30 mins gathering suitable images for the cover art because these songs were never released/finished and so don’t have any
After this I loaded the songs onto my phone to check everything was working
The songs that didn’t exist were still there
So I deleted my iTunes library and added back only the songs from the folders that contain the songs
I then loaded the songs from that
Success
The library is correct now
Next fucking problem: cover art isn’t appearing
Why? None but god himself knows
So I consulted chatgpt
After much deliberation with it I discovered that the likely cause is that the fucking metadata attributes are in the fucking wrong order AND BECAUSE SPOTIFY MOBILE IS FUCKING GAY, IF THE IMAGE ISNT IN ONE SPECIFIC FUCKING POSITION OR TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL OR THE WRONG FUCKING COLOUR, IT WONT FUCKING LOAD IT
So now I have to download another program to fix the order
Problem: nobody will just give me an exe to install it from, I can either install another program to install it from terminal or I can figure out how the guy on GitHub wants me to install it
Next problem: all the fucking files are .xz files, of which I have never fucking heard of before
Next problem, all of the code is in some language or another that I vaguely recognise and am pretty sure requires me to install YET ANOTHER FUCKING PROGRAM SO MY FUCKING LAPTOP CAN FUCKING UNDERSTAND THE FUCKING CODE TO FUCKING REORDER THE FUCKING METADATA SO THAT FUCKING SPOTIFY CAN STOP BEING A BLIND LITTLE BITCH AND LOAD THE FUCKING IMAGE THAT HAS BEEN IN FRONT OF IT THE WHILE TIME
at this point I decided that figuring any of this technical installation bullshit was too much for 1 in the morning and I’m going to deal with it tomorrow
And promptly came over here to crash out
Good night friends :D
My dad says your a nerd
😇
Also new faerun book guys
WE HAVE A MAP
And a list of gods
Chat ive been shafted
Honu's home is barely off the map 😭😭
Not useful for main campaign
Uhh but it litro is tho
Again not useful for main
They have smaller maps for individual regions
Alongside a map of just faerûn
Ben has blended 150 different elements together without telling us what goes where
It’s not just one source book
Cool
Critical role
The map still stands
We are in the sword coast
That much remains the samd
We are also in the north
Some of the time
Our home is in the north/sword coasy
We will be there a lot now
And the gods still apply
Hopefully
Bhall myrkul and the other are all still therr
Also tyr is just there as well ig
Been missing mr tongueless man
Samesied
He did have a name
No one can make potiins like him
Nope
Or atleast i didn't bother to remember it
I remember we did get his name
I just don’t remember the name
Though yea personally I don’t like mixing source books and taking bits and pieces from other worlds
Like what
It just makes it hard for players like us who want to go and read up about the world we’re in
Adding cr stuff to the fearune world
Oh yeah i forgor his weird obsession about that for abit
Ye
*Faerûn
Thx
Eh it wasn't that bad
Whitestone is the outlier
Yw :)
Made it a bit confusing for me
Fair nuff
All you gotta know is
The rest of the world is the same
Maybe
And we've been to the summit of shields in tal'dorei
Ben has been cooking something for a long time
Aye
Well the only critical role location we’ve been too is now rubble
We're headed home chat 😝
How many months have we been in the feywilds for?
And ben has kinda shifted a lot of the setting quietly since the campaigns inception
Too many
Irl or on table?
Irl
No there are 2 cr locations we have been to and only one of them is rubble
What's the other
What are they?
The capital of tal’dorai
Tal'dorei is a real place i believe
No it’s a continent
Nvm cant find it on the map
Tal’dorei is actually a canon continet
Its mentioned in several publishes books
Has its own book as well
Though it’s in similar ilk to eberron
Except while eberron is a separate planet
Besides tal'dorei is a normal place compared to whitestone
Tal’dorei and wildemount are continents
Ye
Crazy how we went to tal dorei to go somwhere like a days trip from waterdedo 🫩
Also ben never told us exactly where we were when we went to those places so it is likely we have visited those continents
And I think if memory stands tal’dorei has a similar thing to the lords alliance
Waterdeep*
Yeah 🫩
Summit of shields
Ye
Yeah tbf honu's home continent is not on the map anymore
Do tell
Right there
Well as was said Ben uses a cluster fuck of locations so your good
Uhhh no
Ill go to where im from
I feel like it’s a little more organised than we may have seen since we haven’t really asked for details
That’s what I’m saying
It probably is
But we as of yet don’t know
Get a look at his arsss
READ THE BOOK
BEN BOUGHT IT FOR US 😭
I have but we don’t know that that is the confirmed map
I’m gonna assume so since we started this campaign being told it’s faerûn
Tho that was session 1
Which a few people missed
ITS THE SWORD COAST
ITS ICEWIND DALE
?
there all there
Nah he informed us as well
The very first session
Every new person was informed
Established as faerûn
The only difference was gods, but he seems to have gone back on that decision
What was the second season and what commenced it
What
Nah that seems to be in order as well
(except of course for midus)
Oh shit miss read
The holy bibble
No the SESSION of OUR campaign
.
Mb that came out aggressive
OUR campaign is faerûn
I apologise
All good cuh
Sword coast specifically
/the north
If i’m being all honest in the time i spent typing that you had realised your mistake
Well we’ve been more out than in
ALSO WINTERWALKER RANGER RAHHH
Mayhaps
But that’s where the keep is
I LOVE THE COLD
Neverwinter is in the north
Its litro a few days walk from icewind dale
More irony to its name
HUSQVARNA, trust in the north <This message was edited>
Is it ironic?
Seems on purpose
You can be a rogue for myrkl now
North is cold constantly
Or more so that some other countries
The region is called the north
And new wizard now has two blade singing subclasses
Also fighter has got a sick subclass
Team leader type shi
Might use that for GH
Seems fitting
The bard becomes a Druid, and the paladin becomes a genie warlock
What’s the new one?
From what I’ve read, it’s pretty much the same
Right
But what is it?
You’ve not answered the question Dakota
It is literally called bladesinger
Nearly identical
Bladesinger was what the original Bladesinger was called
So what is the new one then?
No clue
Chat bad news
Bladesinger
I see
The rogue subclass is literally our worst enemy
The original got changed to bladesinger legacy
Literally
"master of bane bhall and myrkul"
I like the new ranger
Frostpunk chit
Shit
Love the banneret fightrr
Ålla til mig type shi
Ong
Defo making use of both of those
Is frederika gonna switch?
I think so
Or will she remain cavalier
Zamn
No horse
Probably easier for me to
Less expensive
The paladin gets an elemental resistance that can be freely changed every turn costing not even a BA
From 7th
The sorcerer is kinda ass apart from 6th level having permanent counterspell
And regaining sorcery points for it
For new Bladesinger there’s a new perk in bladesong that allows int to be used for attack and damage rolls
Chat 2015 was 10 years ago
Nearly 11
f u
And those kids are nearly out of primary already too
And I would have been 6 or 7

Susutanable transport is not a sustainable mental state

So stan yeah
Don't act all high and mighty

Second is jest

Either way
Your a hypocrite still
No i’m an opp with a flair for hypocrisy
And i do it once in a blue moon to ragebait ceylan
You’re*

Perchance
What time in the morning I must ask

Indeed indeed

Bet let's talk tmr bout it then
i’m gonna sob i want a gecko again
Real
I have a list of reptiles
Guys i may be an empath but i think ceylan wants more animals
I may just be an empath tho
idk how you figured this out….
Ball python
African fat tail gecko
how did you know…?
Stealing my line
EYYY
Psychic powers
Those are the top 2
river
Ceylan
what’s most expensive set up plus reptile
snake
tarantula
or gecko
Gecko
leopard gecko *
damn
which is cheapest
Tarantula
hmm
how much is a tarantula on their own
you bitch..
you have instagram
The cornsnake was pushing £300 but the geckos was pushing £500
He does
He's a ho
WHAT
WHAT
All together new stuff
Second hand is way cheaper
That’s amazing psychic powers
oh right right
if i was to buy second hand what prices would i be looking at
he’s just a silly guy
GUYS I MISS MY GECKOS😭😭😭
we had 2 leopard ones and two of those fuckers
one of the leopard ones
was so fucking
special bless him
couldn’t see
couldn’t hear
couldn’t shed his own skin and we had to bathe him
we had to hand feed him rather than with tweezers or letting crickets loose
he didn’t know he existed
Oh god
I’ve been informed I’m going to watch my mums friend light a firework
I have no clue why me or my siblings need to come for this
I’ve literally never spoken to this person
Enclosure like £60 max including heating and everything
oh mint
for geckos ?
Yep
eyyy
i want a gecko actually
first i mesn
Doit
where the heat is at 🔥
Not really
river what would i name it
Funzies
HEHEHE IN ACTYALLT SO EXCIYED
Not at all
It’s cold, wet and dark
geckos are so chill man i’m just gonna put bro on my shoulder like he’s mf pascal
the jokes i could make
You don’t need to speak, just sit and watch
Real
And I won’t get back until like 10
Cuz it’s a 30 minute drive
river queen could i just use a big plastic container with air holes and obvs all the correct shit inside ?
instead of an actual viv
cos i ain’t got room for that 🥀
You *could* but not forever
like the storage containers if you get me
right
A temporary solution
I also don’t appreciate this being thrown on me at half past fucking eight
On a Friday <This message was edited>

TIL that Loughborough uni is literally right next to Loughborough college
Yup
You can see it from my classroom
Nice
okok1
It’s got one of the tallest buildings around too
But the uni campus is fucken massive
It looks like Birmingham is much bigger icl
lowkey not really
not in comparison to lots of other unis
Most of Loughborough uni looks like sports fields
yurp
Feels it when the bus drives past or I look at a map, but I haven’t looked at many other uni campuses
Like at least half of it
ah right
it’s big compared to college but small compared to other unis
it’s cos it’s a campus type college
Yeah
everything’s in one spot
I’ve just looked at both Birmingham and Loughborough
whereas the city ones are a lot more spread oht
Sheffield is defo the biggest ive been to
And Birmingham looks much bigger
But they are a red brick uni so yeah
Depends
Northumbria and newcastle are also quite central
the city ones i’ve been to have in my experience
Aye fair
Good old stothard engineering UNITED!
STOP 😭😭😭
Its like a fucking wolf howl
UNITED
WHO ARE YA?
WHO ARE YA?
@ceylan have you watched it?
not het
sorting tech issues rn
icloud fucking storage fucking stupid stupid appe
apple
@Oscar Hunt Brown
Just incase anyone was looking for one
was just thinking abt buying one of those
Yk it’s only 6.5k
Ee could prank so many people with that
Steal the 16 route?
Nah just pull up, not open the door and the drive off
Party bus
Or, just pick up the squad and no one else
Fair dues
The party bus
Oh even better idea, we convert it into a mobile home, it has been done
The squad lives together
Ngl living with all of you constantly sounds like hell
I meed my privacy 💔
Take the seats out, stick some walls in
I’m *not* living in a bus and i’m *not* doing it with all of you
Plus we’re all going different unis so by the time its finished we’ll all be gone anyway
Do I hear mystery machine type shi?
No you don’t
Leave me be
RELEASE MEEEE!!!
You’ve already been shaggy with Velma
For halloween
I SEE THE INFINITE UNIVERSE
Not my whole life 🫩
Not the same dude my cuh

[15/11/2025, 13:30:12] William Stothard:
Today i learned that alfred from dc canonically banged queen Elizabeth in his early 30s
What.
hell yea
You heard me
Well no i read it actually
But sure
Read it in my voice
Huh?
Then you’ll hear me
guys why does icloud syncing take so fucking long
it’s been 13 hours
and it’s not done yet
WHAT
i spend 4 hours clearing my photos and videos for icloud syncing to just go slow as a fucking snail
yeah bto
it said to leave it over night
so i was patient
and i did
How .much bro 😭
but that was 14 fucking hours ago
13*
What you downloading cuh
Whatttt
Sounds about right
[15/11/2025, 13:42:17] ceylan:
killing myself
cos i’m getting a new phone next month so i need all my shit backed up
but i had like 20gb too many videos n photos
Zamn
Best of luck bro 🙏
I’m guessing it’s the 10000 photos
Here is where you learn the lesson, clear through regularly
But i may just be an empath
A normal camera can hold that tho
it’s the random 10 and 20 minute videos i had 🙏😭😭🙏😭😭😭
perhaps..
Bro enough w ts..
It’s uploading it remotely that’s the problem
And I thought I had a lot at 3000
Yeah but that takes like 15 minutes tops
Wait nvm
Blind
not with fuckass icloud 🙏😭😭
Remotely is hard
i mean it did say expect overnight
but it’s been a lot longer that…
Could be a Finnish night?
Welp
Good luck cuh
perjaps
also my sister got a car
Yurp
so i got perma lifts😭🙏🙏😇😇😭😭
Bosh
Gimme a ride to college
Pwetty please
she’s employed birch
Champion that
bitch
Damn
yur
Get employed at Loughborough
Then gimme rides to college
i may have to convince her
Anything not to get the bus 😭
Bro its been 2 and a half months
"get thicker skin"
😇
Aww hell nawh
i ain’t gonna lie i came to peace with the bus around december last year
i fw thinking and music time
but it’s a bit worse this year bc of the sheer amount of fucking people
it was not that busy last year
Yeah
First years smh 🙄
Also chat i saw a big 16 on Wednesday
when r they gonna drop out
We’re not cooked
eyyy
Idk maybe never
Same time you do
I give it til xmas
UPS alone has doubled in size this year
We’re cooked
And how many of them are there bc they didn’t get the grades for anything else?
Chat have y’all seen the news that *allegedly* trunp sucked off bill clinton
the year 1 t level ed class is 30..year 2 is fucking 16😭😭😭🙏🙏
More news at 4
YES
I SAW
Tbf we aslo had the stevo's merge
And there’s pictures
What
He’s suing bbc for reporting
Exactly what it says
HAH
LMAOOO
Gl w that
Yeah there isn’t a case
Suing the british gov is crazy work
It’s gonna fall through
*Bbc is a private corporation
I though they were still gov owned
Mb
Nope
Private
Have been since the 50s
Huh
The c literally stands for corporation
Fair nuff
Or company
Which can still be gov owned
No it stopped being the British broadcasting company in 1927
Yeah just seen that
When it severed its ties with the general post office
We both fact checked each other didn't we 🫩
Nah
I just know ts for sm reason
Good for you
Part of my manifesto for hating Jeremy clarkson
Why?
Maybe you’ll know when i publish the manifesto
Poor Jeremy
Ceylan I now share your pain in uni selection
Do I choose the nice one, or the probably better one? <This message was edited>
Birmingham is so fucking nice, but Loughborough might suit me better
YES THATS WHAT IM SAYING
that’s my exact predicament too bro
but you’ve got a year to figure it all out bro you’re all good
like do i chose sheff (a city with good alt music life) or edgehill (the literal teaching school) 🙏😭🙏🙏🙏😖😭😭🙏
Loughborough looks like a shithole compared to birmingham
Imagine having options 😢
yurppp
My options are pretty much every uni in the uk
It’s crazy
on hod i’d chose the one you think you’ll live a happier life at
I have one option
They literally all have ai courses
That’s my predicament
I don’t know which
hmm
what do ou want out of a uni experience
uou
if you want a better social life pick a city, if you want better opportunity also a city, but if you want a better education then pick loughborough
with a course like yours you’ll be more hireable too if you go to a uni with better esteem and i believe loughborough is better out of the two but feel free to fact check me
it’s not like teaching where a job will automically land you a job
the quality of education matters with this one fr
make a pros and cons list on god it helped me a lot
Birmingham is literally rated the best in the uk for ai
And it’s really nice
And the students seem much more enthusiastic
And the cs building is right next to all the cool ones
damn maybe there thwn
Like
Bio science, molecular science
if it’s better reputation and you like the way it looks go for it
it’s really important that you kinda fall in love with the place
And other things that I don’t remember
And engineering
eyyy
if you really love birmingham do it
it’s rare you’ll find a uni you love
But Loughborough
It has tonnes of things outside of degrees
AND
hmm
it has a racing club
Like
Holy shit
Nowhere I have ever seen
Has that
that’s awesome tbh
yeah that’s sick
make a pros and cons list it will make things clearer
Yeah will do when I get home
If it helps (or not) I’m heavily considering Loughborough for a sustainable engineering course
That does not sway me one bit
we just got the new tech building too
I mean no offence
by t level
Whether you go to the same uni will not affect my decision
i swear loughbrough won some shit for having the best tech shit but i may be making that up
No clue
rings a bell or smth
The guy I talked to at Loughborough made it seem really good icl
He was in his 2nd year in the course I want to do
And like
Idk
Birmingham is like what you think of when you think uni
But also, I’m already more qualified for the course I want to do than most of the people I talked to at Birmingham when they started
I think it mostly is down to presentation
Fair
Birmingham gave a better representation of what you do there
don’t be stressing abt it too much at the min bro you’ve got a year
That’s true
I’ll be on discord if anyone’s free
guys don’t eve fucking play
i had my phone on low poeer mode
that’s why it worked last night but not today
i’m gonna fucking die
Huh
the icloud back up
Ohhh
Makes sense
yeah
i knew this too
i just forgor
Well done

Huh
“Worlds a simulation” type thing, but only for one day and inside your own head
No i cant say I have....

although i do sometimes wake up and irrationally think im late for things for no reason
or even just freeze mid day and for some reason think i’m late for anything my
I have a weird thing where im inbetween both dream and sleep but able to switch between the 2 fluidly
YES
Oh yeah there’s that too
love when that happens
i just dip in and out
it’s so fun
In the day or at night?
Like you'll be dreaming about messagung on your phone and then you realise no that's not happening
And then you look at your phone and it really didn't happen
Even tho you swore it did
Night
Before and after sleep
Huh that is odd, that’s a new one
fr??
i thought this was normal
Apparently not

Cocaine bear core
I thought you meant like you wake upand go back to sleep and your right where you left off
No as in instead of waking up when you die it just restarts
Omg sun bears look so horrible
One continuous period of sleep
Oh im so used to them I've started trolling the mfs
The other ones are when the dream feels hostile
Like its not scary

Wrapped in the warm embrace of Gaia

Idk, I’ve only been drunk once
My kind of drunk bro
Lack of balance
Combined with unable to feel your socks or shoes
Tbf I’m a little odd with it tho, the only reason I want to go to space (biggest goal) is to float freely, so that’s what I imagine it’s like

The really long essay on  a final panel of an edition i believe. and it was like hyper analysing the panel and all the hidden meaning behind the artistic choices and what they mean for the characters in the long run of the manga
That includes you
oh ya
my analysis of the kaneki death panel
That's the one
this is the one
incase yall interested:
This panel written by Sui Ishida is an intelligent demonstration of foreshadowing and also maximises the impact of a a pivotal turning point  within the Tokyo Ghoul plot, exploring themes of doom, corruption and identity dissociation. 
Ishida expertly foreshadows terrifying Counter Commision of Ghouls (CCG)’s Reaper (Arima) future one-eyed glaucoma blindness later in the manga, whilst drawing on parallels between him and the protagonist Kaneki, further developing the mirrored and paternal relationship between the pair. 
By deliberately leaving a blind spot within the panel, which also could be simply be interpreted as an artistic choice to draw attention to and encourage the reader to focus on the opposing side, Ishida realised the one eyed blindness that Arima experiences due to the rapid aging as a result of the half-ghoul programme being ran in the Sunlit Garden (a programme in which Washuu bloodlines are being bred and turned into ghouls to create ‘super half ghouls ghouls’ to maintain the human ghoul balance, whilst incidentally starting the catalytic events of the one eyed king revolution). This is monumental, as Arima’s blindness is not confirmed verbally nor even hinted at verbally until it was confirmed in chapter 60 of the second half of the series. This creates a early warning of Arima’s weaknesses, hinting the reader of plot beyond the characters knowledge, positioning the reader in the view of the ‘omniscient reader’, therefore enhancing the doom which can be felt for Kaneki as he battles him as we as the reader can be aware of a way the invincible Reaper can be defeated, but Kaneki is not aware. Furthermore, it further develops the excitement and investment from the reader once Kaneki does finally realise his blind spot. 
Within this panel, Kaneki has sustained a devastating injury from Arima’s quinque in his left eye— one which would spell his imminent doom and descent into madness and creating a fission within Kaneki’s mind. After sustaining the injury to his left eye, Kaneki begins to spout nonsensical ravings along with deep rooted fears as he spirals into death, things like ‘give it back, it’s mine’, ‘why is there no one around’ along with ‘mackerel’ and ‘swordfish’. Kaneki’s descent into madness in this chapter also foreshadows the splitting of Kaneki’s identity further, forming the CCG puppet Haise Sasaki. 
His nonsensical ramblings can be seen before this finale panel, and this is the apex panel before Arima delivers the final blow, leaving the readers feeling utterly unhopeful for Kaneki pulling himself together to defend himself against the Reaper. 
Kaneki can be seen to damage Arima’s quinque ‘Ixa’, creating a sense of hope for Kaneki from the reader as he’s finally been able to get past the defences, but this is quickly dispelled, plunging the reader further into doom, when Kaneki is delivered the final blow.
Another pivotal moment in the panel is when Arima reveals that he does know exactly who ‘Eyepatch’ (the name allocated to the centipede ghoul by the CCG), which Arima says with a fond smile. 
The CCG had been suspecting for some time that Eyepatch was Ken Kaneki, a student who went missing after having surgery following an accident, and eventually went on to link him to the evil doctor Kanou and his ghoul experiments. They found out that he had been an engineered ghoul, which raised moral questions across the CCG, like ‘is he truly evil? is he human anymore? is it WRONG to kill him?’. Whilst this had an effect on many of the CCG investigators, the higher ups/ Washuu did not care for this, and only highlighted him as an enemy, further emphasising their corruption and immortality. 
Ishida’s decision to have Arima smiling here not only adds another layer of melancholy to the panel, but could potentially draw on parallels between the two, as well as foreshadow the future relationship built between the two.  Later in the story, Arima takes the mentor role for newly created Haise, and Haise himself claims that Arima feels like
his father. This is devastating, as Kaneki throughout the story has a detrimental impact on his own mental health due to the role of his parents (his biological one beat him, his adopted ones neglected him, and his found family father died) and the whilst the reader does not the full extent to the effect his family had on him at this point, we do know that any role of parent Kaneki takes on is detrimental and only  spells doom for him. This initial fondness Arima expresses for him, as well as choosing to non-lethally deal with Kaneki and take him as prisoner once he realises who he is, shows that a Arima does not want Kaneki to perish, despite clear orders to ‘let no ghoul pass alive’. It also adds an essence of empathy for Arima, as whilst his smile is fond, it is bittersweet, possibly indicating that Arima feels sad in ‘dealing with’ Kaneki, showing the prior doubt that several CCG feel in eradicating Kaneki due to his nature.   This goes strongly against The Reaper’s nature, as he’s known to be merciless, cruel and omnipotent, only further deepening this initial relationship and foreshadowing for their relationship later, in this panel. 
Furthermore, the intentional artistic and storytelling choice to have Arima deliver his initial devastating blow to Kaneki’s left eye, and to have the injury be just a black hole rather than a detailed wound, which is clearly an intential choice as Ishida has more than proved he’s capable of creating horrifying images, draws on parallels on Arima and Kaneki from their past and the future to come. 
As mentioned, Arima was a engineered half ghoul, designed to be an opponent to maintain the balance of humans and ghouls, keeping the CCG on top, and Kaneki was a university student who had the ‘half-ghoulificaiton’ procedure performed on him without his consent or knowledge, turning him into arguably the strongest of his kind. 
The parallel in this panel of both of them having blind spots in their left eye connects them and implicitly highlights how they have similar destinations, these possibly being becoming a controlled weapon by the CCG, unconsentingly being turned into half ghouls, their place in the ghoul revolution, the themes of loneliness they both explore together, and most importantly their roles as the One-Eyed Kings. 
Throughout the narrative, a feared One-Eyed is said to emerge and reshape the world, and it is unclear who it is, or even if the person has come to exist yet. The search for this One-Eyed King (OEK) is driven by terrorist ghoul organisation Aogiri, one of the primary oppositional groups in the manga who are desperate to have Ghouls rule society. As part of their search, they encounter Kaneki naturally as part of their search as he is a ‘one eyed’, and progressively they take and take from Kaneki, leading him to pursue them in his act of blind revenge and descent into kakuja cannibalistic madness. Aogiri’s actions directly lead Kaneki to this fight, as their actions lead Kaneki to become on the CCG’s radar through his revenge against the cruel terrorised. It’s important to note that at this point, and until the very ending of the manga as a whole, Kaneki never once killed a human, so he should have never been a target for the CCG— only enhancing the corruption within the CCG, highlighting their unjustness, unfairness and speciesism. This is a theme thoroughly explored in the book through Amon and Kaneki. This only makes this finale fight between Kaneki and Arima feel all the more despairing, as Kaneki, whilst not being entirely innocent, has not broken any laws- he is just existing in the body he’s been cursed with. 
In the second half of the series— :re— Arima reveals during their final fight that he himself is the One-Eyed King, or atleast the placeholder for it. Him and Eto— the leader of enemy organisation Aogiri— had concocted this idea of the OEK in order to have one rise to the throne, and that Arima’s tolerance for Kaneki and mercy is because of his hope that he will rise to the throne amidst the chaos between the opposing species in society. Following this fight, Arima could have easily ended Kaneki’s life, but as circumstances developed, Kaneki lost his memories and gave Arima the perfect opportunity to ‘mentor’ and parent him in order to lead him to the throne. Whilst not being so straightforward, it does work, and Kaneki succeeds Arima as the one to reshape the world.
Whereas, the colour contrast between black and white could indicate the sheer difference in their outcomes, for example Arima perishes later in battle with Kaneki, over a hundred chapters  later, whereas Kaneki does not die in the manga, and Arima fails to complete his goal as the One-Eyed King, whereas Kaneki succeeds him and completes the goal. Additionally, Kaneki not only takes the role of OEK from Arima, but he also takes the title of Reaper. Throughout the manga, Arima is known as The CCG’s Reaper, or even the White Reaper, but when Kaneki regains his memories following the Haise arc, he becomes the Black Reaper, regaining his black hair colour in symbolism of the regaining of his person again. This happens whilst Arima is alive still, pitting the two against eachother through titles, but also directly linking the two in their opposing directions. In the initial emergence of the Black Reaper, he did not immediately oppose the CCG, he continued his job whilst biding his time and planning— an extra cruelly and ruthlessness in his actions— but most importantly stopped his contact with Arima. This directly shows the opposing directions they take once Kaneki re-emerges and creates their opposing similarity— both powerful and capable killers with motives, but now following different paths. 
This juxtaposing parallel and contrast in the panel foreshadows such a fate effectively, leaving readers feeling a sense of awe as they realise that all the hints they’ve been given amount to a pivotal point in the plot— and that this has been hinted throughout the entire plot. This only emphasises Ishida’s ability to create and foreshadow plot, an extremely intelligent tactic which only shows that Ishida knew exactly what he intended for the story from the start; all whilst leaving the reader on their toes.

This is monumental, as Arima’s blindness is not confirmed verbally nor even hinted at verbally until it was confirmed in chapter 60 of the second half of the series. This creates a early warning of Arima’s weaknesses, hinting the reader of plot beyond the characters knowledge, positioning the reader in the view of the ‘omniscient reader’, therefore enhancing the doom which can be felt for Kaneki as he battles him as we as the reader can be aware of a way the invincible Reaper can be defeated, but Kaneki is not aware. Furthermore, it further develops the excitement and investment from the reader once Kaneki does finally realise his blind spot. 
Within this panel, Kaneki has sustained a devastating injury from Arima’s quinque in his left eye— one which would spell his imminent doom and descent into madness and creating a fission within Kaneki’s mind. After sustaining the injury to his left eye, Kaneki begins to spout nonsensical ravings along with deep rooted fears as he spirals into death, things like ‘give it back, it’s mine’, ‘why is there no one around’ along with ‘mackerel’ and ‘swordfish’. Kaneki’s descent into madness in this chapter also foreshadows the splitting of Kaneki’s identity further, forming the CCG puppet Haise Sasaki. 
His nonsensical ramblings can be seen before this finale panel, and this is the apex panel before Arima delivers the final blow, leaving the readers feeling utterly unhopeful for Kaneki pulling himself together to defend himself against the Reaper. 
Kaneki can be seen to damage Arima’s quinque ‘Ixa’, creating a sense of hope for Kaneki from the reader as he’s finally been able to get past the defences, but this is quickly dispelled, plunging the reader further into doom, when Kaneki is delivered the final blow.
Another pivotal moment in the panel is when Arima reveals that he does know exactly who ‘Eyepatch’ (the name allocated to the centipede ghoul by the CCG), which Arima says with a fond smile. 
The CCG had been suspecting for some time that Eyepatch was Ken Kaneki, a student who went missing after having surgery following an accident, and eventually went on to link him to the evil doctor Kanou and his ghoul experiments. They found out that he had been an engineered ghoul, which raised moral questions across the CCG, like ‘is he truly evil? is he human anymore? is it WRONG to kill him?’. Whilst this had an effect on many of the CCG investigators, the higher ups/ Washuu did not care for this, and only highlighted him as an enemy, further emphasising their corruption and immortality. 
Ishida’s decision to have Arima smiling here not only adds another layer of melancholy to the panel, but could potentially draw on parallels between the two, as well as foreshadow the future relationship built between the two.  Later in the story, Arima takes the mentor role for newly created Haise, and Haise himself claims that Arima feels like
his father. This is devastating, as Kaneki throughout the story has a detrimental impact on his own mental health due to the role of his parents (his biological one beat him, his adopted ones neglected him, and his found family father died) and the whilst the reader does not the full extent to the effect his family had on him at this point, we do know that any role of parent Kaneki takes on is detrimental and only  spells doom for him. This initial fondness Arima expresses for him, as well as choosing to non-lethally deal with Kaneki and take him as prisoner once he realises who he is, shows that a Arima does not want Kaneki to perish, despite clear orders to ‘let no ghoul pass alive’. It also adds an essence of empathy for Arima, as whilst his smile is fond, it is bittersweet, possibly indicating that Arima feels sad in ‘dealing with’ Kaneki, showing the prior doubt that several CCG feel in eradicating Kaneki due to his nature.   This goes strongly against The Reaper’s nature, as he’s known to be merciless, cruel and omnipotent, only further deepening this initial relationship and foreshadowing for their relationship later, in this panel. 
Furthermore, the intentional artistic and storytelling choice to have Arima deliver his initial devastating blow to Kaneki’s left eye, and to have the injury be just a black hole rather than a detailed wound, which is clearly an intential choice as Ishida has more than proved he’s capable of creating horrifying images, draws on parallels on Arima and Kaneki from their past and the future to come. 
As mentioned, Arima was a engineered half ghoul, designed to be an opponent to maintain the balance of humans and ghouls, keeping the CCG on top, and Kaneki was a university student who had the ‘half-ghoulificaiton’ procedure performed on him without his consent or knowledge, turning him into arguably the strongest of his kind. 
The parallel in this panel of both of them having blind spots in their left eye connects them and implicitly highlights how they have similar destinations, these possibly being becoming a controlled weapon by the CCG, unconsentingly being turned into half ghouls, their place in the ghoul revolution, the themes of loneliness they both explore together, and most importantly their roles as the One-Eyed Kings. 
Throughout the narrative, a feared One-Eyed is said to emerge and reshape the world, and it is unclear who it is, or even if the person has come to exist yet. The search for this One-Eyed King (OEK) is driven by terrorist ghoul organisation Aogiri, one of the primary oppositional groups in the manga who are desperate to have Ghouls rule society. As part of their search, they encounter Kaneki naturally as part of their search as he is a ‘one eyed’, and progressively they take and take from Kaneki, leading him to pursue them in his act of blind revenge and descent into kakuja cannibalistic madness. Aogiri’s actions directly lead Kaneki to this fight, as their actions lead Kaneki to become on the CCG’s radar through his revenge against the cruel terrorised. It’s important to note that at this point, and until the very ending of the manga as a whole, Kaneki never once killed a human, so he should have never been a target for the CCG— only enhancing the corruption within the CCG, highlighting their unjustness, unfairness and speciesism. This is a theme thoroughly explored in the book through Amon and Kaneki. This only makes this finale fight between Kaneki and Arima feel all the more despairing, as Kaneki, whilst not being entirely innocent, has not broken any laws- he is just existing in the body he’s been cursed with. 
In the second half of the series— :re— Arima reveals during their final fight that he himself is the One-Eyed King, or atleast the placeholder for it. Him and Eto— the leader of enemy organisation Aogiri— had concocted this idea of the OEK in order to have one rise to the throne, and that Arima’s tolerance for Kaneki and mercy is because of his hope that he will rise to the throne amidst the chaos between the opposing species in society. Following this fight, Arima could have easily ended Kaneki’s life, but as circumstances developed, Kaneki lost his memories and gave Arima the perfect opportunity to ‘mentor’ and parent him in order to lead him to the throne. Whilst not being so straightforward, it does work, and Kaneki succeeds Arima as the one to reshape the world.
Whereas, the colour contrast between black and white could indicate the sheer difference in their outcomes, for example Arima perishes later in battle with Kaneki, over a hundred chapters  later, whereas Kaneki does not die in the manga, and Arima fails to complete his goal as the One-Eyed King, whereas Kaneki succeeds him and completes the goal. Additionally, Kaneki not only takes the role of OEK from Arima, but he also takes the title of Reaper. Throughout the manga, Arima is known as The CCG’s Reaper, or even the White Reaper, but when Kaneki regains his memories following the Haise arc, he becomes the Black Reaper, regaining his black hair colour in symbolism of the regaining of his person again. This happens whilst Arima is alive still, pitting the two against eachother through titles, but also directly linking the two in their opposing directions. In the initial emergence of the Black Reaper, he did not immediately oppose the CCG, he continued his job whilst biding his time and planning— an extra cruelly and ruthlessness in his actions— but most importantly stopped his contact with Arima. This directly shows the opposing directions they take once Kaneki re-emerges and creates their opposing similarity— both powerful and capable killers with motives, but now following different paths. 
This juxtaposing parallel and contrast in the panel foreshadows such a fate effectively, leaving readers feeling a sense of awe as they realise that all the hints they’ve been given amount to a pivotal point in the plot— and that this has been hinted throughout the entire plot. This only emphasises Ishida’s ability to create and foreshadow plot, an extremely intelligent tactic which only shows that Ishida knew exactly what he intended for the story from the start; all whilst leaving the reader on their toes.

2. ⁠contents 
3. ⁠an overview of a topic
4. ⁠deep dive on topics (for as many slides as you like)
5. ⁠summary and conclusion
6. ⁠questions 
7. ⁠obligatory silly image
I’m gonna do the story of honkai impact or one of the characters
Probably one of the characters
I fucking love the silly images at the end
Would always do those
do the otis guy
YEAA
That’s what i was thinking icl <This message was edited>
hell yea
Well then follow ceylans method more or less
Ok
Thanks
Thank her
if you’re gonna do a character i recommend following the format
1. early life
2. ⁠pre game
2. ⁠in game 
3. ending 
4. ⁠analysis
Thanks
Will do
so with the analysis you draw conclusions abt behaviour, choices, as well as summaries and opnions you have about the character
although it totally up to you spicing things up always adds a little fun
Sound advice this icl
Might nick it mysen
yer bird is gonna be a teacher i need to know how to make a powerpoint 😭✌️

Maybe, I’ve got masses of an assignment left to do, and my topic is more a collection of fun facts without proper research (I haven’t talked about it since year 8)
Research then cuh
But I’ve found out that the thing I had at the weekend is cancelled so I can stay over and do dnd in the morning
Yay
Kill that fucking hag for me amd albus
But where to startttt
The beginging
Can i do the entire history of the planet krieg
Why tf not
But no way am o doing the history of it, we’d be there all night
Bro what is it
The holy roman empire?
Neurodivergence and LGBTQ+ an the links between
Autism=trans according to the gov.
That is a lot of them
Sorry other way around
Yeah that too
Screw it, yall may just end up with a fun facts without proper discussion instead if a ppt
Then you cant present bro...
Its a presentation
[Ik, I don’t like standing and presenting)
Guesss my special interest cuh

Bosh
Guys i found out the cause of my brothers death today
After 14 months
Oh?
What was it then if you dont mind me asking
Sudden death, cause was epilepsy
1 in 1000
Oh dang
Still an ongoing investigation for other stuff tho but that's what we have been told
Is it good to have closure at least?
Meh
Its what we guessed it was gonna be from the start
Why after 14 months tho?
They lost his brain
It was meant to take 5 months
Well yk now
They found it after a year and thankfully it was preserved but yk
Anywho that was my 'good news' of the day 😛
Yippee
no.
yesss
Its short dw
yea he can
It can be summarised in 10 minutes
you ain’t the ceo of
ppt bruh
Just go piss for 15 min coincidentally
(No it cant)
Do “history of the world I guess” might run a little like tho, like 20 mins
glad you got the closure queen
That fucking video
that’s a solid plan
I can either do the history of krieg or the procedures and history of NBC equipment
Pick one
Yep
I refuse the question
Do either
Do procedures, but not the history
Interesting choice
People usually go the other way
I hate history with a passion
Unless it’s for a game
Then it’s peak
I can deal with game history, I usually actually care about that enoigh for it to sink in
So you’d rather i yap about the correct tightening of gas mask straps and appropriate application of duck tape to cbrn suit sleeves <This message was edited>
Yep
no god no please don’t please

Too late i already started
damn..
i’m so so suddenly sad i csnt do sleep token
Why not ong
i lack the hours of research needed for the mythology linked
How much can there possibly be
Then leave that part out?
no it’s all or nothing
you’d be shocked
that’s the beauty of sleep token
Bro why?
Names and dates just do not stick w me, I dropped that shit as soon as
Fair enough
But the message of history is so important
Sure I agree w that, but why do I need to know if spintickler the third jester often court made a joke that started a war?
Cuz its all relevant
cos it started war
the impact of  politics  bruh
History is about understanding what man has done before and rejecting it
One should never repeat history
Good or bad
Fire was history? No more fire?

TEALLL
Not the meal we are having however
spongey creamy coffee alcohol
So i need to understand which part is problematic
The spaghetti or the bolognaise?
both
When you say fancy for dress code, is that strictly formal fancy, or casual fancy too?
a cheeky little phobia
I think it’s like you and that biscuit
Formal fancy
it’s all good tho i’ll bring smth
Those keep mounting in numbers
Ate too much now won’t eat it
oh
yeah exactly
i ate 3 bowls and threw it all up

it’s been like 10 years
Bad news, I don't like coffee
Biscoff

Will hasn’t eaten eggs since he was 3
Taste buds change cuh

Hi
hi
suit.
I have suit.
Bring suit.
I’m ditching the blazer but i’ll wear my waistcoat
Don’t wanna overheat
I’m gonna appear with blazer and then not wear it for the rest of the night
As is tradition
And I will ask my parents about watch
Cuz I have one
But they have it
Because my grandad left it for me
Unfortunately no ones died in my family for ages so my funeral suit will likely be too small
Try it on first
Then decide
Simples
My suits an all in one
Weddings, proms, funerals
Thatll be tomorrows decision, I have too much work to do now (actively procrastinating)

Astroneer is officially fucked :(
The update is a buggy mess

And the host runs at 5 fps on the ps4 version
And the import save function doesn’t work
And the new large canisters have been balanced horrifically
And the megatech stuff is absurdly expensive
And you can’t access megatech at all in creative because missions are disabled
Somehow this is worse than risk of rain’s 2nd dlc
:(
I didn’t even know it could get worse
But at least I can play my game in stunning 4k 60 fps now 😔
eyyy
i got my assignment done guys
so i will be able to finish my ppt
not tonight cos i got no spoons left to give
but tomorrow on bus and during my lunch
so i’m ending it all
Time to cancel cuh
Sad 😓
Yea the Xbox one has gone from £10 ish to £22
After they promised they woudknt for those that didn’t cancel
😭
so i had a dream where i had this humungous room sized reptile encolosure with a bunch of different shit in it and as i was cleaning it out the lid came undone and suddenly it was all in my room so me and my mum began cleaning everything out slowly but surely putting things back but we encountered a tarantula that was evil and he tore my toes to shreds and i accidentally broke one of his legs whilst panickiningly putting him away and then out of anger he ate the snake
not sure if this classifies as a nightmare
but the turantula previously to eating my toes was running across my face
i do not have a phobia of these things mind you so idk why my brain cooked this up
Were you scared?
yeah but dream scared
not real scared
I get ya
Uhh
Probs nightmare then
If only barely
idk i felt pretty chill waking up
cos i went to a waterpark afterward
What after waking up?
the enclosure followed me there tho it was in the corner of the water park
no no before waking ip
Damn magic enclosure
yurp
I dreamt of meeting an old friend again
It was very wholesome
hell yea
Stan and river were there as well i think
And then i think i succeeded at biology as well
So yk peak dream
Prophetic
Hopefully
[21/11/2025, 07:10:11] ceylan:
looking in my notes is so funny cos i never remember these dreams bro
i write them in the daze of waking so i don’t remember
like fuck you mean i met vessel and then danced with a mark zuckerburg version of him
it’s so funny that i imagined he was mark zuckerberg when i literally know what his face looks like
"a bag and shag" is wild work
Also mark zuckerberg?
Like what
And where’d the gazebo come from in your neighbours?
The garden probs
literally have no what it’s supposed to mean
no idea they don’t have one

my cosplay stuff came
And the wings?
not here.
i think i’m just gonna cosplay the young  sister
to save me money and makeup skills
so no curse and no wrinkles
but then the baby vooodoo folls i ordered won’t work
grrrr
Guys ngl kinda feeling like I dont know if I have “best friends” the best way I have to describe it is I don’t have anyone who I have a connection with like Stan and Oscar no one who would be there for me no matter what <This message was edited>
I would be
Without a shadow of a doubt
I will be there for you
If you have any issue
Ever
I will help to the best of my ability
You will never be alone so long as I breathe
And I know that but the bond you and Stan have is just different
You’re different people
With different interests
And different personalities
And I don’t talk to anyone as frequently as I do with you
I know you better than I know my siblings
For longer to
Technically debatable
Because I live with them
But that’s not my point
You have known me and have been semi regularly meeting with me since pre school
I know
The point is yes me and you have know each other for fucking forever and that gives us a bond but it’s very different to the one you and the rest of the group have
True friend ship that is there not because of age
I think we’ve discussed this before
I see your point
And I’m not really sure how to respond
Because of love (in a friendship way)
What do you mean? /srs <This message was edited>
You and everyone else act as if you have know the people around you for decades even if you have only known each other for a fraction of that time
Meanwhile for me it actually takes those years if not decades to get that connection
Honestly, it’s just finding likeminded people
I just got really lucky
Jasmines been going through a similar thing for the last 6 months
And evidence would suggest I am less lucky
I’ve never had any problems relating to friends
I would disagree
I wouldn’t say you’re unlucky
As I said, I just got really lucky
I found the people that I love to be around very quickly
I’m sorry I can’t help with this, genuinely. I’ve never been in your position.
Context: Don’t get me wrong I love all of you guys as friends it’s just that there is something that seems to happen between all of you and not me
If you think there is a way, please tell me
My priority, as always, is your (and everyone else in this group)’s happiness
It’s a complicated issue
If there is anything I can do
I’m not saying I’m not happy in the group, what I’m saying is (and I will be honest here) I envy the ability to look at a person and just become friends
I get that
But it also wasn’t that simple
For some people it is
Me and Stan have always had similar interests
Or so I say
My first memories of talking to him were about warhammer
He introduced me to it
I met him through jack
Who was *the* nerd at the time
And I met him through will Donaghy, who I had been friends with since about year 3
And am still friends with
My dad always says, “it’s not about what you know, it’s about who you know”
And I think that perfectly encapsulates the difference in situations here
I guess?
You’ve had to move schools several times because they shut down
And lost many, if not all of the friends you made (please correct me if I’m wrong)
That never happened to me
Quick question how long did it take you and Stan to become friends
I just made 2 or 3 friends in primary school that lead me to where I am now
That’s a good question
I don’t think it was long
Maybe a few weeks at nost
But
Not all but connections were massively strained
We weren’t anywhere near as close as we are now
How long on
None of mine were
Well, except one
But I don’t think about him any more
Wdym?
How long did it take you to get to your current status of friendship with stan
Its difficult to pick a single date, but I’d say probably that first night where we went out to sence valley
So around 4 and a half years
That’s not to say we weren’t close before then
We were
Cuz I would like to note that at my school I have known kids for ~4 years and am only now beginning to become friends with some of them
But it shifted my perspective somewhat
I will stand by the fact that I’ve won the lottery in literally almost every way in my life
Please, don’t compare yourself to me
I mean that in the most sincere way possible
I can’t stop winning type shit
You get my point though
The issues that most people face, I just haven’t
I’m comparing myself to everybody around me
I’ve never had to work hard for anything
At least you can recognise that fact
Not many people can
I just don’t know how I can help
Who also seem to be able to make friends at the snap of their fingers
By comparison to me
Nah not quite everyone
So is it an autism thing?
Joking
Correlation, not causation
For me it actually may be
I don’t know why but over time people start to not like me the more they get to know me
Yeah I get that
I did have that once
He was my best friend through primary school
But we drifted away in year 6 and stopped talking entirely after like half way through year 8
I was the one holding the relationship up
The best example I can think of is climbing. At first people found me funny and good to be around but six months later they found me annoying and a pest
I stopped, and didn’t speak again until the start of this year where I messaged him about other people from Overseal that I found at ashby
Well you’ve been around for more than 6 months, so I’d call that progress at the very least
To be fair with you guys it’s not exactly been smooth sailing
Depends on who you ask really
Yet the wind that threatens to blow the ship over also pushes it further towards its destination
I’d say it has been, compared to jasmine for example
That is a quote and half
Where did you find that?
Quote book
I hope he made that up on the spot
Apparently I get wise when I’m overtired and trying to be helpful
I did
Yes <This message was edited>
Same sometimes
Tis true but still the storm is not  yet over, it has calmed but still ongoing
Then take what respite you can to prepare and gather your supplies and allies
I got a question: is the storm just Leo’s shite mental health?
Perhaps
Alternatively, life in general
Cuz he’s had rough time recently outside of us
I know he doesn’t really interact outside of gatherings
Either way this is outside of my expertise
The storm represents the conditions of my social life in the group in other words unstable
Personally I would disagree with that
Because it wouldn’t make sense then for the winds to “push it further towards its destination”
Which is a stable and positive social life
I assume
Now I’m gonna try and sleep
I will talk tomorrow
Good night broski
The logical assumption is if you as a group experience something that I do that you don’t like you tell me and we work through it
Is this made of your tears @Stan
Yes.
Might still have a staff sgt’s boot polish in it
@ceylan go to the charity shop cuh
ty bro
i decided not to tho in favour of some extra sleep
Fair
Good luck today everyone
That you cuh
You too
Somone punch that fucking hag for me and albus
i accidentally fell back asleep

Lady’s and gentlemen and anything between I have just ran the numbers and my scrap storage for my astroneer world is fucking huge, 190 scrap is 6.4% of it

Please tell me were going home soon?
Soon
Ben says we should be out mid next session
In the new year at latest
Oh
Unfortunately I did basically get thrown into the feywilds
Sad
Yeah
Just retcon it bro
And basically nothing went well for me
Ive never met you
Oh and ceylan is a hoarder now
And we nearly got tpkd by some bread
Therefore it didn't happen
The situation did not make sense
Also someone gave lucius firebombs for some reason
Ok then
To deal with the near tpk from bread, I got forcibly changed an then just stood there and let them explode when they touched me
Huh
Onyx turned me into a lightning hulk as the only one left standing, and one of their traits is that anyone that melees them takes 2d6 lightning damage
Okk
From that we got the final key and rolled terribly to clear the way to use them, but we got there and went through a passage of faces into a cavern
Ok ill need stan to explain this clearer for me later
Yeah this would be better explained in person
naur
Hwæt do thou be hoarding?
Or should honu wait to be surprised?
Cyberpunk shi rn icl

IVE JUST GOT 3 5 STARS IN 30 PULLS
WHAT THE FUCK
THATS THE REST IF MY LUCK FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE GONE
I ALMOST WON 3 50/50s CONSECUTIVELY
I’m guessing the odds aren’t supposed to be 1/10?
no
Not even close
0.6%
Oh wow
Yeah
It’s bc you saved up so much luck from doing hardly anything for the first half of the session
I made 30 pulls for a weapon and got it
Which is unheard of
And 20 pulls got me 2 5 star characters
Dang
Ok ceylan i understand now what you mean about the new OW character
How does one take jq, make them thinner and give them less clothes?
Props to the design team for giving all the new talon characters the sams eye colour
Huh tf
Is the new one just a skelton? <This message was edited>
Reference point
Is she thinner than JQ?
Clothes were an option
Like half her size
Oh alright
My main man mauga still on top tho
JR the real skinny clothes optional king
saying goodbye to my life weaver skins

Around maybe the 14th of December?
Could you do it the day after or before
We'll see

Its all a maybe bro
It could be the week after
On that exact day I have a village thing I know my mum is going to force me to do
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRJAGwSA/
Chaaaaat
I may or may not have overproduced graphene
By forty
I needed 10💀
And I made 50 for some reason
Atleast now you don’t have to make that 40 later
Exactamundo
I need 20 of it for stage 3
I need 20 fucking nanocarbon alloy
75 fucking steel
And 200 fucking compound
Late game that’s not too bad
That’s horrible tho
Among other miscellaneous ingredients
The nanocarbon is about as expensive as the steel
It’s literally taken me and Leo 2 days to complete 2 out of 3 stages
And that’s just ordering and refining resources
Literal fucking hours
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNRJD9WvK/
Thankfully we made an astronium scrap farm during stage 1
So we actually had the funds for this
There is the fully renewable method that we were using before
But that was much slower and couldn’t be automated
I think we’ve burned nearly 1,000 scrap over the last 2 days
[24/11/2025, 21:02:54] River:
FINALLY
Been waiting a few days for these to arrive
I forgor
How many waffles? Obviously the answer is Snek
The answer is clearly catalytic converter
Nah its Noir
Or perhaps
Aussie dr nefario
I think the racist lizard wins this time
🥺
Weawwy?
Stoner dragon
[24/11/2025, 21:18:43] River:
Just a few resources
Shit death man
Yeah
And I’m still not dome
Gotta make some nanocarbon now
That’s what the titanium alloy is for
We’ve already had to refill the argon canister once
And Leo’s off to get helium now
He’s gonna have to go refill the argon again later
Cuz we’ve only got 15 left
Fucking hell
This is for stage 3
I’ve made stage 2 ttoday
And I’ve been at it for about 3 hours now
Just sitting here ordering and refining resources
Literal hundreds <This message was edited>

Ive had a set for over a month and barely anything us out of it
Ik there's 3 girls in the house but adams bald thats got to make up for sumn right
EVERY 2 DAYS
yuh
Damn bro
my hair is greasy ahhh and no amount of training i do on it works
it’s in the genetics sadly😢
Same icl 🫩
Nah we go through like a bottle or two a month
That sucks 😔
WHAT
Every day in secondary always asked "have you washed your hair"
I GO THRU A BOTTLE EVERY 3 MONTHS
me every day ever fr
Bout same for me
WHAT.
WHAT
HOW ???
WHAT
IDK
I LATHER TS
Ita just shampoo bro
How much do you use at once Ceylan?
Good question
like a handful and i shampoo twice
That'll do it
the grease doesn’t scrub itself off
Use your hands?
Genuine question
what do you think i use?😭😭
Idk bro
Get a scalp scrubber idk
Ik grease is tough
It worked for me
i have one but i prefer being in control fr
But it aint that tough in my experience
this says nothing about me as a person
You widduwy are
You controlling ts
😖
Handful, once, but I also now use a little like brush thing (also helps with dandruff) while it’s lathered up
Yess
I have a brush and a scalp scrubber that I usd
i think i should probs include that im counting it as a household collective and my sister and mum have FAR longer hair than i fo
Like it’s not a proper brush, closer to a massager and it’s got spikes but they’re rubbery and soft
Even still
if it was was just me i’d probs get through like 1 bottle of shampoo per 2 weeks and 1 conditioner a week
But I also have a condition that makes my skin extremely dry so I gotta have those extra steps
Like 2 bottles a month is crazy
A little goes a long way
Literally how tho
idk bro..
I barely get through my mums conditioner
that’s insane
use more conditioner
makes your hair luscious and soft and amazing
It does
i use like 1.5 handfuls of that shit
But like
I just use a little
not enough buddh
And it does wonders
i use for all my hair but the very roots
and it comes out so soft and lucious
Samesies
As long as you distribute the conditioner right, you don’t need much at all
I acc need to buy more conditioner icl
Im out
Wednesday shi 😝
Truth
i’ll have to disagree unfortunately
Ceylan how much hair you got
atleast 5 strand
Cheers pal 👍
You’ve got like hardly any compared to the rest of us three, how are you individually using more than we do combined?
idk bro but i love my luscious soft hair so im doing smth right
Hold on do you condition every time you shower?
you don’t ????
what???
Nope
I do
that’s crazy the
byw
Once every week more or less
you need to condition EVERY TIME
Nah every time
i don’t wash and condition every time i shower but if i wash i condition
Whoopsi
you NNED to condition bro😭😭
every time you wash
cos when you wash you strip it of moisture
and when you condition it puts the moisture back
Thank you mother 🫩
could be why you get greasy hair too
But mah thx fr
cos your scalp basically
overcompensates
and produces too much oils
Cheers tho
Ill buy more conditioner on bday
Chat i feel a cyberpunk nirvana rn
And ill wash properly then
Expect sessions in the near future

So
I spent the last hour and a half making a transformer and normalisation mechanism for my llm
I’m now figuring out the differences between activation functions
Those being GELU and ReLU
I don’t remember what they stand for tho
There’s also SwiGLU
But I don’t know much about that one
But basically GELU is better than ReLU for ai because it’s literally smoother
If you graph the two, there are no sharp edges in GELU but there are in ReLU
Google?
I don’t really need to know tbh
And it was in the book
I’ll come across it again
I just can’t be bothered

Doctors don’t know anything

No pressure or judgement here bro, do as you need
Chat i lowk hate how my hair feels conditioned
Its always feels fucking matted
And ive been brushing for like 20mins now 😭
Brush it with the conditioner in, as you wash it out
hmm
probs doing it wrong
with curly hair you brush in the shower
don’t wait for your hair to be dry when you brush it too
Brush from the ends, work your way towards the roots
brush 10 mins or so after getting out of the shower
Fuckles 🫩
semi wet hair
Literally dried my hair first
Gonna kms
don’t brush it whilst it’s soaked out of the bath too cos you increase breakage
broke number one rule bro😭😭😭
Well thx for the advice
Ill go wash it again then 🫩
naurrr
don’t
Fine
over washing isn’t good too
just spray it down
and brush
Cheers for the advice tho!
With? Water yeah?
yuh
not too much
just damp the ends
Gott it
Chur
brush from ends to tops
tips
Its crazy that ive had this hair for 8 years now and im just learning this shi
just a bit
Tbf it took me a while too
guys i promise its okay to ask your mum about hair care
girls also had to ask their mums
It took me so long to be told your meant to let conditioner sit for a couple mins
See i was a lil bitch at first so my mum gave up
She had to forcibly brush my hair at first
I was like a walking ravens nest bro 😭
😭😭
also guys treat your hair to a hair mask every few weeks
these can be diy literally just condition for like an hour while you do your jobs or pick up a hair mask every
who’s fault is ts
11 yr old me cuh
No clue what a hair mask is mate
just a deep conditioning thingy
makes your hair soft n shi
Ill look into it
Window for helldivers with me is closed
I’m watching I’m a celeb for the rest of the night

Nah cant do that
You stupid ass bitch
Such is the life of an adventurer
Gotta submit an absence report the night before, i do not believe will was in a state to do that
Ho youre the one that told me he was having the day off dont even pretend to be smart in the gc rn
I *assumed* he would be
Because i would
But he hasn’t
Pussy
Ladies calm down
Calm as a cucumber bruh
Cucumber is vile
It’s meh
I’m not a fan or a hater
It’s just there
Cucumber is fucking sexy
Cucumber sticks 🤤
Cucumber salad
It’s not 
It’s like biting into a stick of crunchy water
Exactly
Refreshing
Ladies calm down
Water shouldn’t be crunchy
I like the texture of cucumber
No 
This is the hill I will die on
But the taste is rank
Jack you literally ate fried flakes and called it crunchy water, you cannot be saying ts <This message was edited>
He’s got you there jack
You did so multiple times
Yes but that was a joke and it tasted like chicken
Water should not be crunchy <This message was edited>
Mhmm
And it also wasn’t water
It’s more like sm cruchy with the taste of water
T’was metaphorical water
Since it has a shit tonne of water in it
BEAUTTTR
Yes but calling it crunchy water is a lot more appealing than crunchy juice or something else like that
not yth
ttue
I genuinely read that as butter
dude i’ve submitted them anywhere from 8 in the morning to 12 pm ON the day
Widuwlly is
Says so on the portal my cuh
You could probably get it amended
Leave it to a UPS student to actually use the Portal <This message was edited>
But will is already getting cooked by his geo teacher
no
it literally doesn’t matter
it would be a ridiculous rule bc how can you predict you’ll wake up feeling unwell ?
You can’t
So you get it amended on the day
But for an *approved* absence
It must be submitted prior to
dude what the actual piss r u on about
u just log it on your ilp it takes 2 seconds
i promise i know what im talking abt im absent often enough
That’s not a good thing cuh
such is the way of life cuh
Also the person getting nearly booted for low attendance
an exaggeration of the truth 🙏😖😭
somehow there’s people with lower attendance than me btw
i’m at 71%
What do you need to pass your course?
Cus mine is 85
So i tried to submit an absence
But?
But it said 845 was not a valid time
Submission made at 830
don’t need a specific attendance to pass
Damn
just got to have it be high enough to not get kicked out
We need a minimum of 85 or we aren’t given a grade
bro wtf
man that shucks
tbf we’re the same with placement hours
we need like 95
If we don’t have the 750 hrs we don’t get a grade
Yeah but you also have examinations
Just realise we all do different types of course so there isn’t actually gonna be an overlap
and coursework bro
Chat the hangover has just hit 😭
My head is thundering

WHWRE
This one cuh
ohhh i didn’t know her namw
me and mum were laughing alot at thay
there were so many nsfw of this poor girl
That makes sense
I assume you’ve not watched overlord?
She is a succubus after all
She is one of the horniest characters in the anime
Tied for first
ofc i haven’t
For a guy who is literal bones
Do it
i don’t watch gooner anime🤥🤥
It’s not
It’s not, she gets absolutely no chance to use jt
But it’s also not like
Great
It’s mediocre
the figures tell  me everything i gotta know bro🙏😭😭😭
Why does this sound like something a modern which would say?
"consulting the bones"
LMAOOO
modern day witchfraft
i’ll give yall a haul when  i’m back
Bros casting augury
Guys my voice is fucked icl 😭
Literally doesn’t, it’s just bc sex sells and she’s ironically a succubus
I dont think its ironic bro
Have you seen it?
No
But
Saying "sex sells"
And then saying she's a succubus
That’s a general principle of marketing
Doesn't really tell me its ironic
The ironic bit is he doesn’t want to and cant
And she’s uncomfortably horny constantly
It’s not ironic
It’s just porn
There is no saving grace

Also has anyone else started like writing descriptions for how their dnd character does certain combat stuff?
Like spells and attacks?
Nope, but it’s also mostly thematic anyway
Huh
He’s not started descriptions of actions, but how they would be done normally is thematic enough for his character <This message was edited>

This may be correlation over causation, but it seems to be every poly person I’ve met it a freak
A little, but unrelated
Just the trauma my guy
Oh

Yeah that’s correlation
Unfortunately I am madly in love with only one
Damn guess that lot i knew had more trauma than i knew
Nice try bro
Good
Science has failed me yet again
What even is this convo tho
What does this mean 😭
Explain it like I'm an alien who's still tryna find out how to b human
Dakota knows poly people are freaks
Was wondering if your freakiness is the result of being poly
He is mistaken

I'm gonna make a mistake tonight chat
I'm gonna cut my hair or get high
Get high
You'll find out tmr prolly
FUCK YEAHHHH
I mean
Oh shucks
If I have to...
Getting high can be recovered from more easily, you dont have much hair left to cut
There are less long term effects than cutting your hair
Buzz cut
Tbf stan you should probably have listened to that advice
Fr
How many times
I HAD too
Uhuh
Plus i like my hair short
I like having smth to grab
Hey River, my gf (who is reading this and wants you as a wife) thinks you’re my side chick. Stop cheating on your wife and boyfriend with me <This message was edited>
She also agrees with this (but has yet to prove)

Better not be
I’d have to get even edgier if you did
Oh god
Thank you, she will sleep easier tonight
Good excuse to start tagging tho
Its November,at least edge properly

Yeyahhh
Sorry, this was not new info for me
New or not, should you have that info?
Or anyone from looking at us icl
For all they know I could be bullshitting
Idk, but truth or dare did also reveal it
Ok?
#abstinance
I didnt ask for the info
Just cus i told y’all really doesn’t mean it needs to be shared consistently
that's a sin
I wonder who's gonna die first here
Me
Yeah stans gonna try with the military, but i think he’s too good a soldier to die in battle
I’m gonna succeed
They dont let you try dude
Idk
But suicide by armed cop however…
The Ukraine seeming pretty tempting
Hey so maybe don't
Not up to me
Up to them if they let you close enough
They dont need idiots they need competent, sound tactical minds

Btw y'all how do you feel about animal pelts?
Well
Don't like killing animals for it
But
They last longer than fake fur and in the long run are better for earth
So
At the market today
I met a german hunter
He was selling some absolutely beautiful pelts
So i did purchase
Because they are warm and snuggly
He were a good pagan bushman
Hell yeah
Show
Sure?
I bought 2
Fox
And hare
They were killed at the same time
Because the fox was hunting said hare
Oh that’s cool
Everyones ok w this yeah?
I dont mind as long as they’re cleaned
As in me posting an image of animal skin bro
They ain’t freshly killed de
Dw
Yeah that’s fine
Some people .might not be ok w that
If not just send privately
Just do it as a single use photo
Bet
Warning animal pelts!
How much were they
Also in world news, Switzerland has denied women the national service obligation
Hare was 40
Fox was 55
River pinned a message
Good price for freshly made
In other world news, Germany has started national service
Fresh ish
This autumn im guessing
The man was german
Only a season ago fr
They are really cleanly cut as well
Skinned and tanned
Amazing quality im assuming
Like the fox has all the fur up to where his paws are
Its real fur 🙏
Dayumm
So its like having a cat on your shoulder always
It also means i dont perish for stroking it
I prefer when people have stuff like this rather than the plastic version because with proper care it'll last generations
Yeah i intend to make a very nice cloak out of them
They should be warm as anything
He was also a lovely chap
Made the drinking horn i have now as well
Viking shi right here

Hands down
No competition
It’s so fucking cool
And
You guys should also be able to understand it
I shall be investigating the ideas presented in the video at some point
Cuz it relates to the research I was doing into multidimensional graphs
I feel like polynomial formulae are linked to it
Oh my god I think I’ve found my new favourite youtuber
Emergent behaviour is so fucking cool
Interpreting a function in a different way so you can do shit like (+ * +) is awesome

Sick
Just asking cuz it is starting to cost a bit
Fair enough <This message was edited>
I need to check my spending bc I’m starting to eat into my buffer, but idm chucking a £10 every so often, or paying for snacks at co-op
10 would be great
The meals come into the range of 30-40 max
So 10 would be swell <This message was edited>
But it means I won’t be able to pay for snacks every time
That's fine bro
Cool
With this money me and stan can do more
Chat do you ever realise that as a species our hair length is inconsistent asf
Even within one person
Did you know the word fuck came from medieval royalty?
Go on
It started as an acronym: Fornication Under Consent of King
Back when the king had to give permission for each child to exist
And similarly, giving someone the middle finger started off as threatening to have sex with them
Can i get a source on that please?🥺
Best I can do is the TikTok i got this from

Wtf stan
Nah I’ve seen it happen, fully accurate
Was it crazy that i was thinking about bringing up trans people?
Not in a bad way ofc
Explain?
Nēse
Wait I have a trans meme
Damn all I have is a trans man and trans ex friends
Start collecting em
I tried, they weren’t interested in letting me in the polycule
They were still fun to be around tho
Woah
I meant as friends
They are a little weird icl
Just a lil strange
Yeah however, the whole polycule kinda fell apart and like half the group isn’t even in college anymore
Wdym cuh
They were kinky as shit and I got to hear all about it
Ahh
Very interesting stories
You and will knew them?
I was part of the friend group, Will observed from afar
I thought all poly ppl were freaks
Yeah I came to that conclusion the other day on here, but Stan corrected me that it was just correlation, not causation
No it’s more like “all poly people are freaks, but not all freaks are poly” <This message was edited>
Fr
Thats the trouble
Im just mentally ill
I'm too jealous to be poly
We all freaks of some flavour here <This message was edited>
Like how it’s a stereotype that trans women just drink white monster and play fallout new vegas
Doesn’t mean all white monster drinkers are trans tho
Right?
Perhaps
Stop it i just stopped thinking about monster
Redbull time then ig
Nah
I prefer monster
This message was deleted.
It’s specifically the white one
My throat hurts
Monster will not help that
Ik
Im gonna drink blue instead
Perchance water?
Is it odd that I often find trans men more attractive than cis people in general?
That really depends on why you find them more attractive <This message was edited>
I think I like trans men in a lesbian way
Well that doesn’t make any sense
Yup
transphobic btw
You see my issue
Is what I was afraid of
Being lesbian for a trans man is transphobia
Since to be a lesbian is to be a non male in a relationship with a female
I say in a lesbian way, but I also don’t feel female when I do
So in a homosexual way
Dakota bro id just leave it
haha right? right?
Yeah sorry I confuse myself
If you are a male who is attracted to another male, that is homosexual
In the rawest definition
it’s okay to be straight or in a straight relationship my dude
wait
other way around
GAY
It’s ok to be gay
But I also don’t feel male?
hi guys terrible news of the day trans girls have been officially banned from girl guides
Are you perchance, nonbinary?
You a pansexual for sure
My personal gender seems to tak a backseat, but something about the way I feel is almost lesbian but not from a female, or towards a female
hmm
so
Dang, the guy with surname Potts is pan
are you perchance trans ?
or do you wish to be in a sapphic relationship from a non binary perspective
Sometimes
Well they say it’s not from a female perspective
I’m guessing genderfluid
ohhhh the overuse of female here is hurting my heart so much💔💔
Much more of a day to day thing than a definitive identity <This message was edited>
my poor little feminist heart
If anything, demiboy
Makes sense
So if I had to choose one, male, but most of the time it’s whatever most convenient (often to the bit)
Alphabet mafia rise ong
Exactly
Crash the cis-tem chooms
They can’t offend us if they don’t know what they’re offending
In other news the US has successfully banned gay marriage in texas
bro???
Time to nuke Texas
More specifically the texan government branch successfully repealed the bill which requires a state to allow gay marriage
It’s not banned per-se but it is no longer a right
Well this seems like a healthy convo
Genuinely
Everything bigger in texas
Including homophobia
Yup
But that also means the gays are bigger to fight them
Guns
Just shoot everyone
Start over
Political action?
And good policy reforms? <This message was edited>
I dont understand why people get offended by love
Alongside encouragement to vote and improved education on these topics
Literally nothings wrong with it, no ones getting hurt
People's biology see it as wrong
How
But we as a species possess unbound intelligence
Depends how kinky you get, but even then it’s consensual
Why are we still trapped in our animalistic tendencies
Yk way back when humans didn't care what parts the other had
Literally had giant orgys
And it’s not even like no animals are gay, many many species have documented committed gay couples around the world

@Dakota
Yippeee
Wake up.
Timing and a half, I’ve just finished packing my fruit for tomorrow
No thanks, I like the dreams where I’m with at least one of you at a time
Pause
Although today has felt slightly nightmarish
Paused?
What happen
Since I woke up I’ve been a little over half deaf and I have no idea why
It’s still going and I may have to live tomorrow with it
maybe ear infection my bro
lots of head colds going around
It’s also affecting my balance and patience
But it doesn’t hurt, and I don’t have any kind of cold
Ur are all welcome to help reform parliament
@ceylan do you vote?
Hey Stan, you want in on my family’s way of dealing with parliament?
[Gunpowder plot)
Maybe a legal manner that gets us respected on the world stage
If we blow up parliament are we any different than terrorists?
Or freedom fighters depending on your personal views
Nah that’s js for shiggles
That’s an ear infection
Should pass in a few days
Yes
Worth going doctors over?
If it lasts longer than a week
Cool
Chat am i mental?
[02/12/2025, 23:11:03] William Stothard:
Yes
🥺
Anyone watched stranger things yet?
Magepunk is where the heat is at
YEA
Haven't watched a single episode cuh
Also chat why does ow comp have to be so toxic?
Like i did nothing amd got fucking flamed
Like bro..
Its almost December 3rd
What about it?
Its a day
Steal someone's jumper cuh
Why?
You wouldn't get it...
I KNOWWW IM SOBBING
What about it
yall ain’t true conan gray fans
Never heard those words in my life
Sorry
ILL FIND A HOODIE JUST PULL UP I SWEARRR
Please
You wear someone else's jumper

Listen to heather by conan gray
Im gonna go for a bit
Bit shaken rn
He’s shooketh 
Why
Dunno last game just hit me a little harder than i was ready
Wanna just crawl into my metaphorical shell and stay there for a bit
But i need to stay out of it
People ain't shit
They don't matter fr
Yeah see i care too much
I do see
But you'll get to the point of not caring someday
But i do care
I now you do, and it's amazing that you care so much but eventually you'll learn that not everything needs you to care this much ykwim

Who’s in this morning chat?
memememe
and i n non uniform too
Man mine was yesterday
127 or 16?
@Dakota ?
Kinda need to know
So i can snag seats
I’m getting on 127 y’all took too long
mb i was listening to some politics dumping
i got 11 mins i’m chill im almost there
Dakota could be dead
Also my phone also only half fucking charged yesterday
So I’m already fuming
I think I’ve figured out how combining tensors can store contextual information
You know how when you look at a window during the day and you can see some reflection but you can also see outside as well
So you can see both
Right
It’s kinda like that
The light reflecting from both is combined and allows you to see the reflection and outside at the same time
Oooooh that's cool
Cuz the way you add the context vector to the input data is literally by adding it as a matrix
I figured this was the same thing
If you split light into a 3d vector containing red green and blue values then the same concept can be applied
Yeah basically just a combination of two inputs
Yeah
It’s hard to wrap your head around with ai
But it’s easier to understand with light
doing the first aid course is bringing back my paramedic / doctor yearning
Always a possibility
not when i’ve applied for primary ed and got interviews🙏😭😭
Don't become A doctor, become The Doctor
Nah bro you still can
But you do you cuh
what
nah too late they ain’t gonna like my ass if my passion changes very suddenly for a ps
[Dr Who)
Yeah true
Have you applied to anywhere doctory with your ps? if not then they don't know if its changed or not
I think we're trying to say you can
It would just be messy
can’t with t levels tbh
Man what a day
That’s crazy
Yup
Paramedical science is always an option
We got a fucken Wii in b11 now
Boutta hit up wii sports
What is ashby even about
Peak
That’s what it is
Liam’s bringing a ps3 tomorrow
Dear god
When are you bringing the gamecube in
When I find one cuh
wait a couple months, bring the gamecube 2
Do you mean the gabecube?
With the companion cube front decal
[Stan while ive got signal, we going GB or not?
Chat what do you say to a mental health service when you want help?
Cuz like im struggling to know what to say
Nah
Nah
Is the squad hanging out?
@ceylan
Ill be in the box office then
Spam ceylan ong
Do you know what you want help with?
Anxiety, stress and probably depression
Along with bad learned behaviours
Talk contact our therapist?
It’s in the insurance
Idk what to say bro thats why i asked
Ik who to contact
Start by booking an appointment
Say
Dad sent us the link for the health services
Use it
Stan
Say “appointment please”
Listen
I’m listening mate
I’m telling you what to do
Your missing the point
alright good, now you can just ask for help with that
I assure you they have ways of starting and sourcing a conversation
You gotta get an appointment first
And they do that through phone call
And idk what to say
And you say
I want an appointment
And appointment please doesn't cut it
literally just tell them your struggling with this and you want help
Say you want mental health assistance and would like to book an appointment
The rest of the details will be sussed out in and around the session
Thank you
Hope you get the help you need dude
Good luck
I hope so to
i want to so bad
nah i only got 20 min lunch
You just need UCAS points
And a level three
Anyone else seen their Spotify wrapped yet?
Yurp
No actually
Weirdly none of my top 5 songs were by alohaii
Despite him being my most listened to by a literal country mile
Wdym 219 genres?
I got 263
Ok nvm i get it now
Like with artists, it includes the multiple genres that songs fit into
I also listened to almost 1500 artists
Just found that Geoxor has been in my top 5 every year since I found him in 2020
He was my number 1 in 2022
My top genre has also changed every year
This is a 49 minute album 😭
It’s moved slowly from modern alternative to kawaii future bass
Mine has changed i believe
Nz reggae dropped 2 spaces
My top album was summertide by Alohaii which doesn’t surprise me at all
[03/12/2025, 13:34:17] William Stothard:
My top 2 are the same album
[03/12/2025, 13:35:16] Oscar Hunt Brown:
Also you know how Spotify makes a playlist of your top 100 songs
Mine is telling
This year they included how many times you listened to each song
It’s really cool
Yeah mine just shows me where ive been hit hard
There wasn’t even 20 listens between my top 10
And most of that is the gap between 1st and second <This message was edited>
Yeah my first drops off hard
300 down to 189
Zamn
I also listened for like 60% longer this year
Almost 90k minutes vs 55k
That’s crazy
peak
I may take a listen
Bro it is not that good im just autistic 😭
Ill leave songs on repeat and work icl
Yk who is that good?
Alohaii
A quarter of my listening this year was them
Damn
I really thought a larger portion of mine would be alohaii
How much?
He was only like 7k of almost 90
90k?
Yup
Holy fuckles
86,556 to be exact
Damn i doubled nearly from last year 😭
I had that last year
2022 was 11k
2023 was 25k
2024 was 55k
2025 at 86k
And 2021 was 9k
The craziest thing last year was that I only found Alohaii at the end of october
He became my most listened to artist within a month
I got into sabaton around april
With my top 2 songs both being his
How old was your listening age?
20
33
Well my top genre was kawaii future bass
I was expecting lower to be honest
Power metal to no ones surprise
Yeah
The funny thing about my top 5 songs is I haven’t listened to 4 of them recently
Neither
Although
One just came on
Lemon melon cookie
Rambunctious beat as jasmine calls it
And the reason I got into TAK
He doesn’t have many songs though
And his most recent 2 have been his worst
Im excited to see everyone elses now
Same icl
I found that while I don’t have the stats from 2020, I still have the playlist
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EM7C0mzY3PAVt?si=u2HFE4qFSPqCVxdpKNYXrw&pi=u748BmL3Q_m3p
Not a single one of those songs is still in my top 100

OK cuh
@Stan SUCK MY BALLS
i remember in like year 9 when i started to get into music i used to genuinely tweak cos i couldn’t comprehend how people got like 80k+ but turns out you just gotta let music consume you
That’s crazy
He said i only listen to 2
And those 2 are?
Guys im cooked
Elvis or metal
peak
GUESS IT

Shit is crazy
But this book is old
Like its falling apart
Mum said she'd take me to yours to do some work but then she's changed it to "no it was IF you did this and I'd be giving it in" when the thing im doing was gonna be done at yours
Do ya get what I mean
Restore it fr
Thankfully mostly the religious bits are
Ill try
Its so annoying 😭
I have the option for help and I get its late now but I've also been waiting all day for a response
Just realised my favourite song of ask time isn’t in my top 100 this year 🙁
It was in for both 2023 and 4
Sad 🥺
I’m guessing the reason why I’ve not listened to it much is because it’s a 45 minute mix from my goat Geoxor
And I have a tendency to blast my eardrums when I put it on
Bru
Bit busy rn
I didn’t see that tbh
And I’m on helldivers
It’s here. A recap of my #SpotifyWrapped https://www.spotify.com/wrapped-share/e12006dd29c54b2aa0f595e59b6789c3?si=KTogQzf-RPmb8Xa0VxbLEA&destination=datastories&lang=en&feature=wrapped

Indeed

Must've been a poser
You are not a cougar
Literally the youngest
Bitch I just posted that
And what
Stans is 60
Which is why I said cougar
Old ahh bitch
Wrinkleddd
Listen to your elders bitch
Stan not you dw
I’m not worried bro
Do Not Be Afraid
Also
Also
What?
You said also
I was awaiting elaboration
Nah im just lonely cuh
Words of wisdom
Ive finally got someone out of my life who i really should've earlier, but now ive just got no one to talk to
But its better than being a net ig
That is the problem with getting rid of people
She got rid of herself
But i just know she's gonna come back
And i really don't want her to
Don’t let her then
Walls
She's in my photo
She's mega guilt tripper No1
Manipulative asf
Block her
She'll just get fucking mad in person
Mkay
Not your problem
Stan it literally is my problem
I am too easily bullied into shit
Cut contact entirely
If she tryna talk to yiu ignore her
After enough it becomes harassment
Involve the cops if it continues
Bet*
Get Stan to summon the goon squad
I need help not caring
Who's got advice?
Now this I can do
Gwan
Do you have friends to form a human shield with?
Huh
Put your other friends between you and her
Physically separating you from her
So here is what you do
If not, noise cancelling headphones and sat in a corner
Don’t talk to her
One at a time please
Done
Claim moral high ground since she walked away
How?
Remind her of that fact constantly if ignoring her doesn’t work
Finally, sit away from her and make it difficult for her to “bump into you”
That i can do
If she gotta go out of her way to harass you then you can make it a case
Next question
How to not get guilt tripped
Cuz this i need serious help w
River says “don’t be a pusssaaay”
Trip her right back
Helpful
Put in nice terms you gotta ignore her
Then you gotta remind yourself of why things are the way you are
Remember the facts
Yup
The bullies never expect to get bullied by the person they’re bullying, so it’s the most effective
Huh
Don’t trip her back
Just don’t engage
By being “the bad guy” you validate the vilification she is already doing in her head
Idk what guilt tripping she can do
Just be solid in your opinions and values
Whatever she does if you can’t ignore it, give back in equal measure (make sure she knows it’s only exactly what she’s done tho)
No just don’t engage
These people thrive of attention
Act like i hurt her, that its my fault, that she cried over me
I’m pretty much always available to talk or play sumn
By even giving her any recognition you are giving her the attention she wants from walking away
And so what if you did
She made this scenario in her head
She did too
It isn’t real
Im fucking weak bro
I feel too much
You gotta disconnect from her
She ain’t shit to you anymote
Done and dusted
My best advice would be try and ignore her or find an excuse to be somewhere that isn’t near her
Her value to you was made null and void the second she said she was backing out
Aye
So nothing she says matters
She is nobody to you
Aw fuck
Her words have no effect on your life bro
Just realised how imma get guilt tripped
Words only matter if you let them
That's good advice
How do you stop caring
Like genuinely
There is no formula
You just stop
You don’t give a fucking shit
Cus she ain’t mean shit
She has no value
Doesn’t affect you
Aint your problem
The less you think about her, the less impact she has <This message was edited>
And she can fuck off
Eventually you forget about her and all is good again
I more meant like mind tactics/exercises you can do
There aren’t any
Not caring isn’t a science
Its just something you do
I guess remind yourself that she doesn’t have any control over you
You are your own person
This is also true
As a professional UPS tosser
You don’t gotta give a shit about anyone else
All that matters is you and what you want
Chaotic evil in this motherfucker
Become ungovernable
Bro why does this feel impossible
Like wdym just stop
What
Does
She
Mean
To
You
She's the psycho girl who put me through now 4 different stressful situations
And has guilt tripped me 3 times
Nothing.
She means nothing.
Hang on
She is less than the dirt on your boot
What are your thoughts on her?
In what context
As a person
How does she come across to you
What does she mean to you
Face value she's fun to talk to
Underneath that when i turn my brain on
She's pretty crazy
And not in a good way
Ok
Best way to start not caring is to talk about something else
We’re talking about her and you’re thinking about her
That is already way more than she deserves from you
Good point
Go play overwatch
That is a good point
Enjoy your life without her
Cus she doesn’t mean anything within it
I require human interaction right now
Defo block her tho
Aight
Can anyone provide
I’m on discord
How does one block on teams?
I don’t know
I haven’t used it since covid
Aight its all good
Muted her
Cool
No time for email
Now*
Is that something she’ll think to use?
I assume so
She did in past
Damn
Im amazed it took me this long to switch my brain on
That kind of person tries to keep it switched off, it’s not your fault
Morning chat
Who's feeling good on this day
Me bro
How come bro
No clue
Just am
Anyone else?
Also oscar bro i got my hmw finished
Im not cooked!
And i remembered my contacts today
So feeling good
Nice
I’ve just had an hourlong assembly on how to not die in a car
It was probably the worst assembly I’ve ever had
Probably one of the more informative ones
But I had to sit there and watch probably 30 people die in accidents
Hope your all good bro
I am
Just sad now
But I did get to skip lesson 1
Silver lining
And I have computer science next
And I only have a 3 lesson day now
Today's is gonna be a good day
Horrendous day 😭
That’s crazy
Naurrr

Woah woah woah
Hard r really bro?
guys grow up guys
Literally 18
Unc the lot of you
Sorry forgot there was a literal fetus here
I’m not even the youngest
Dont matter to me cuh
Everyone join ts
Thought it was for the dnd group?
Since we’d all be there on the 20th to exchange
I was thinking
Cribmas party on the 20th evening anyone?
yeah it is ?
i just sent the link here for river
Will saying everyone join it
That would make it like 13 people total
Teamwork management and leadership training
Lower minimum wage
Most working hours
That's kinda irrelevant icl
Being the perfect drone?
All you need for a job is previous and RELEVANT work experience
Also an understanding of how and why teams fail and what affects their work ethic
Which yours barely is
No employer looks for that shi
And what's your previous experience stan?
Where have thou been employed
No experience and irrelevant experience are basically the same
But mine is relevant
Working in catering is relevant
When did you interact with the public or work a till
Catering is catering
Calling it catering is a lie cus you did kitchen work
My brother in wodan
Wtf do you think being a caterer is
That's a fancy word for kitchen staff
What food did you provide
None
So you weren’t a caterer
But i am trained in cleaning
And you didn’t do any caterering
Alr welcome to the club
Not true i served a few times
Do you have a certificate?
Do you?
Yeah actually
Sick
Point is
Ladies please
Also it’s a zero hour contract at a small gaming company that happens to have a bar
Calm down
I doubt experience is essential
Out of all applying people
I have the most relevant work experience
Bruh its a job all experience is essential
No you don’t, because you didn’t work catering, you worked in kitchen sanitation
Job title was kitchen staff
I did more than cleaning
guys calm it fr
Stan they are right
Also ceylan literally has cleaning as part of her course and work experience
This is literally pointless
I’m ngl i’m doing thjs for the debate
Well its annoying
It’s not heated nor am i heated about it
yurppp
Well i think everyone is sick of it
Gotta go brb
cleaning, working with children, cooking, working with adults, food prep first aid yk
Ceylan is most certainly the most qualified
She has the most working time and relevant experience
But she also has a higher minimum wage and less available hours
yeah unfortunately
spitting straight facts
And also guys have you seen some of the employees there
I doubt they’re begging for work experience
Its an entry level qualification
They just need competence
lmao yea
Now who sports the greatest competence here?
5 hours costant work without break
I could rag you so hard rn but imma don’t wanna be an asshole about it
i have to do 8 hour shifts consistently so..
Worked the worst days in the history of the establishment
I did 8 hours as well
48 straight hours if field exercises
I just worked nonstop for 5 hours
I agree
Me
I find jt funny i asked for competence and we went straight back to working time
Which in itself isn’t very competent
When you work potwashing Sundays
Competance is key
Or else the whole restaurant stopped
When you raise the next generation, competence is key
shi
When you carry lethal weapons, competence is ley
Key
sociability
i’m probs most sociable
Doing a job requires competence
Its a bar job not a evening gala
The longest sentence you gotta say is “do you want ice with that”
Also the customers in there are the “that waiter talks to much” crowd
Icl wth is this convo
Lets just agree ceylan is up at the top
A debate
you started it😭😭
EYYY
Except stan did
On this chat dumbass
Yea
Yeah it was done on the dnd chat
Was happy to leave it
.
okay gang calm it
I’m calm choombatta
Calm as a renta-cop in city centre
Yes ma'am 🫡
reminds me that I need to finish cyberpunk
And arcane
may start anew cos I can’t remember shit
And Rick and morty
And finding a skill to teach adults for 5 minutes
I think you'd just finished finding the guy who made the biochip?
And takemura was torturing him?
SHHHH
Spoilers?
Cuh you did it
Leave takemura alone?
ya ya i got to the part where i just agreed to make peace with keanu reeves but details fly by me
And?
Yeah you'd just got on w him
Mutual agreement type shi
Maybe i’ll beat it again before  ceylan continues?
Could be fun
perish
It’s all good choom
I’ve done it all so i don’t really worry about the details
How about you organise some cyberpunk red stan?
Run past people like a junkie on some of that maelstrom puff
If we find a day to do it i’ll plan it
Not an attack btw
Didn’t think it was
Ik just its felt very hostile these last few minutes so thought it good to distinguish
Also got let out of papd early 💪
Today is a good day
stan can you do me a solid and remind / motivate me to play cyberpunk on sunday pal
Sure
Play cyberpunk on sunday pal
do it on sunday😭😭😭😭
Ik i’m just messing with you choom
Dming cyberpunk red is pain cus ik all the interesting shit i can do for characters but can’t play them 😭
the trick is to play a companion
Dmpc
Yeah dmpcs dont work
This is a commonly known issue
Why not?
just do it anyway highkey
Just don’t mtagame
It’s a barebones play experience
I don’t get the same reaction that you guys get since ik what’ll happen
Fair enough
And i have to manage the session
It’s not actually playing a character
Its having a friendly npc
If i wanted those one of you could play exec or lawman
i may make a new character for it
i’ll let you know
Could we get some details?
Generic cp setting?
Alr if you need advice then my garage is always open choom
hey don’t abbreviate that….
Or special?
yuhhh ty cuh
Details for what?
Cuz the diesel punk session was fire
I’m waiting for the 2077 map and rules to come out then we’ll be back in
Ok
Albeit 30 years later
when’s this you reckon
I’ll probably make another solo then
They say early next year
mint
Bosh
The book also includes a pre-made campaign so i am begging someone else run that so i actually get to play
i’m happy to fr
but i ain’t buying the book
Dw i will

I’ll still be running a 2077 campaign but i wanna play one too

In my experience the signs were always right
Get the 127 spend the extra 3 squid

What sights
Queens park
The rushes canal
Queen’s Park, with a glass Coke or two from tooleys
McDonalds
Idk

An hour+ is worth 3 squid imo

I’m the nomad for this edgrunner gang
Whimsy?
Then its 6
Well in
LETS GET WHIMSICAL
Hands off my stereo
Tbf ceylan might be right
Pubs in ibby have
Interesting clientele
You mean bigots
Racists
Gammons
Homophobes
Transphobes
Classists
Theists
Do I hear a riot starting?
Not rn
We'd lose
Later
We are but 5-7 people
Gotta run more jobs for the fixer so we have hella eddies to buy up some nova gear <This message was edited>
Is that a thing dave? A 2 man gang?
With a singular cybernetic enhancement between us
We could start an edgerunner gang
I’ll be the nomad
Will is the muscle
Uhh
Jacks the fixer
Oscar the tech/runner <This message was edited>
Would ceylan or oscar not be the muscle?
Well oscar is the runner
Multiple muscle?
Ceylan is the rockerboy
Im good with mechanics
just say im emo
We’ll need a medic, and Ceylan did a course yesterday
Can’t drive tho
And you cant fix
We both nomads just different flavours
I absolutely can
How much is broken on your floor that we've thrown out
Yk i do have mechanical experience right?
But i have car experience
Some are lost causes
And it’s not that i can’t
Stan lets stop this beford it spirals
Its that i dont have the toolds
Your forgetting the two actual engineers in the group
I’m js saying you’re doubting a lot of me
As are you of me
But anyhow
Anyhow
Such is life
You are also one of the strongest
I can be muscle and tech
Am i fuck
Multi class yk
Stan your literally a UPS, there’s our lawman
ur right
Fair
Stan as solo?
Their role ability is summoning the goonsquad
Or would that be me?
Lawman is the pick
You and me cuh
That would make you the muscle
Solo and muscle are synonymous
But i aint shit for strength
Gun?
Muscle doesn’t actually mean strength
That i can do
Melee or ranged weapon?
It’s slang for whoever is packing heat and combat experience
Aight bet
Exactly
That i can defo do
I need my driving lessons and welding qualification
so im med AND muscle ??
I can help w a welding qual
Alr sick
Nah weve put me as muscle dw
I’m ngl I’m considering asking for a welder for my bd
Lowkey I’m kinda just a jack of all trades
In the non literal sense
I can pretty much take any role
Literally one of the tech descriptions
Leo as the exec?
Oscar is our tech/runner
Rockerboy?
Absolutely not
I said pretty much
Not all
Ahh fair
Do we need a rocker boy?
Also guys remember that roles are just one thing you can especially well
Ceylan hasn’t learnt base yet
I have some drum experience if nothing else
Is bro not the only one with a certificate for an instrument
Last i checked
Only qualified musician
That is true
BASS
He’s our tech netrunner tho
but i WILL learn bass
Sorry I forgot cus of how useless itnis
Media?
Leo?
Well so far the people that have played group cameraperson is me and you
WAIT ID BE MEDIA
DEADAAS ID BE MEDIA
i’m most chronically online
i know the internet better than yall
I agree
I would also disagree
Choom doesn’t even know what https stands for
Gonk as mf
Stan how charismatic are you online?
who the fuck does
Not at all
I think outnof all of us ceylan gonna fit media role the best
Me
It’s the difference between media and netrunner
that’s what i’m saying
Oscar knows how the net works
Exactly
Hyper text transfer protocol (secure) because http also exists
well i’m not netrunner cuh
Ceylan can socially manipulate it
oscar is fr
yuh
I’m explaining that dumbass
Coding vs filming

Nah you need a certificate like nobby /j
*_ATTENTION DOGTOWN… THIS IS KURT HANSEN*_
Just cus i’m a nomad smh
ur an awesome alt person with fans basically
Yeah actually
Shit
Just cus i’m from the dogtown ends
That remimds me ceylan you'd just finished one of the dogtown quests on cyberpunk, that's where you left off if i remember
Yeah actually
Subhuman
Barghest is watching you
Creepy fuckers
What if im watching them?
Then you might get shot up gonk
Call me oðinn bitch
There are no gods in dogtown
Just hansen
This is what they call me. I am called Glad-of-War, Grim, Raider, and Third. I am One-Eyed. I am called Highest, and True-Guesser. I am Grimnir, and I am the Hooded One. I am All-Father, and I am Gondlir Wand-Bearer. I have as many names as there are winds, as many titles as there are ways to die. My ravens are Huginn and Muninn, Thought and Memory; my wolves are Freki and Geri; my horse is the gallows. I AM OÐINN
Whats funny is that barghest is still relevant to wills faith
Being an evil spirit
Ik what a barhgest is
Hilda fans rise

Mountain hound
Typically pets of Jötunn
Now just the figure head for a bunch of militech deserters
Favourite street slur
Also chat the 127 just never turned up
@Oscar Hunt Brown you all good for ingredients tomorrow bro?
Also fun fact for the day chat seeing colour is like your nervous system having spare hdmi slots
Should be
I’ll let you know if I need anything
Sick
Elaborate please
Your retinas contain "cone" and "rod" receptors
Yep
Both are connected to sensory neurones
Yep
But cones are connected 1 to 1 (directly)
Rods are connected in groups of 3 alongside having a lower range of light wavelength absorption
Right
Cones are fewer across your retinas
And only function in higher light sources
Yep
Hence why you have worse vision at night
Yep
As your lower wavelength rod cells are absorbing less light
It just struck me as funny
I’m not seeing it
Pun intended
Now that i say it
Ive lost myself
But its still a fun fact
If you wonder why yo night vision is shit
But that's also why blue eyes see more
As they absorb a wider range of colour
(technically green absorbs the most)
I still don’t see the relationship between the difference in retinal cells and hdmi ports
There connection on a diagram reminded mo of shit cable management
That makes more sense
Joke explained
But where did the spare ports come from?
Evolution gave us more sensory neurones so that we could differentiate colour
And use conce cells at all
Hence spare hdmi ports
I give up
Its late

You can basically cut it out and use it as a sticker from that
And it just adds it to your keyboard
Damn that's way better than android

He just gets high and passes out anyway
Lets get our ziggy high
So unrelated note, but like why is it so hard to find tasteful art of sea goddesses?
Not looking in the right place
But like
Because finding someone who does high quality digital art and isn’t into freak shi is incredibly difficult
Rán is a regular ahh goddess with minimal description as a whole
Why is there so much art of her that is so freaky
Because sex sells and art isn’t very lucrative
Show some examples please
I wanna see if it's just freaky or if it's interpretation
“One pornography please” 🤓
Its just interpretation icl
Mate shut up
Its not freaky
Alr
No need for fishnets fr
Like bottom right would be an amazing photo
If she were wearing literally any clothes
But?
Gods and godesses dont necessarily wear clothes either tho
Being naked isn't a sexual thing, it's simply been made into one
Depends
Tends to be in relation to them being representative of primal forces and clothing being a “human” invention
But gods are representatives of humans
It tends to be minimal or but a singular sheet of cloth and jewellery
Antigods tend to be more natural forces
Antigods?
The enemy of the gods
Also gods from a purely pragmatic perspective (not necessarily the “correct” view) are human creations
Not the bad guys
Just the antithesis
As such we interpret them in ways that please us
Stan mate you don't need to tell me this
Ik but i’m just saying
But i already know
Also the art is mostly tasteful
Yeah that’s not that freaky
Ja now that ive got past the stuff that unsettles me a little yeah its mostly normal
Just gonna shut the fuck up
It could be a lot worse
Yeah she could be freyja
But we expect this of freyja
Also fun fact
Today was the day
Prohibition ended in the states
Sounds like an excuse to get fucked up
Provide the money cuh
Agreed
Provide the alcohol and i shall drink it cuh
Provide me w money cuh
No cuh
Half of those aren’t even freaky
Preach
Women’s bodies aren’t sexual
Btw
Bruh its just me
Bare skin freaks me out
then don’t complain if it’s a you problem 😭

Gang, what are your thoughts on Will Austin attending the Christmas function on the 20th?
Don’t know him too well, but probably woudknt mind if just for one event
My reason for asking is mostly because he doesn’t really have any friends outside of me
And like
I don’t want him to miss out yk
Is he a chill guy?
Yeah
He’s quiet like me
But like
More
Swag
Unless I’m around
Then he yaps about as much as ceylan
Ill be slightly intoxicated so if he says smth out of pocket he's getting punched
Along with anyone else
Has to be quite out of pocket tho
Borrow my hand, it’s insured and hurts you less, them more
Slightly?
Slightly
Bet
Gurl there is no slightly when you get alcohol
Tis crimuh

If there was one day of your life you could repeat, what would it be?
I don’t remember the date, and it doesn’t include everyone here
But I’d pick the first night we went out to sence valley
WITH THE AMORETTI IN YHE CAN
Yeah
probably last day of high school party
10/10 night
maybe also new year’s party last year was sooo good
I’m glad I can remember that night
it was a good night
Yeah
summer nights with SOME drink are always so good
It was coincidentally the last function I didn’t drink
That’s not why I chose it though
Imma say either this years anniversary w Charlie bc sh came and met yall, or the camping night at yours Oscar
Which one?
Fins party or the gcse one <This message was edited>
I’ve only been to yours once, so the gcse one
I thought you were there for fins?
I can’t wait for next spring so we can camp again
Yippee
damn right
Nope, fin is probably the person I’ve least interacted with
Huh
Do you guys ever remember a memory so good you don’t want to do anything?
Just chill
what
A bit difficult to explain
But like
Living in the memory for a bit I guess?
ohhhh
right
yea
i get you
Yeah I get that, usually at inconvenient times like middle of a test
Huh
I’ve never had it when there’s something specific on my mind like that
Usually when I’m just in my room
I love you guys
Ok ‘night
Nighty night dude
love you too bro gn
tonight was nice!
We doing this or what
We’re waiting for big Jack to put himself on it
Force him to join it
What about small jack
He’s being held hostage
Stan got to bed
He ill
Go to?
Go to bed.
River how drunk are you rn?
Im not
I am sober
I have an ice lolly
Oooh fun
Its yellow
Like acidic piss
Tastes like it too
Then stop eating it?
No
Its cold i like cold
Normal ice cubes? Stand outside?
Nuh uh
It said he was typing I'm not crazy
Crazy?
I was crazy once
Ice cold Coke?
I want coke so bad
A glass of or a bag of?
The original kind
A bit of both
In a glass
Bet
Share
I don't have any
I just want some
Damn the bottle of Cok in the fridge is nearly empty
Gimmeh
There’s like half a glass left
Could fill it out with the balls I sometimes have with cok
They’re made of watermelon
Frozen
You guys good with me adding will austin to this gc?
I’ve just realised he’s not in it

Perhaps reconsideration after the Christmas party?
Ok
Same here
Me three

not too fond of the fella sadly
Dw I’ll make sure he plays nice this time :)
wednesday panto thursday revision friday placement crazy lineup
Overwatch, anyone?
Holy shit
I just popped the fuck off as vendetta
9.5k damage
And 18 kills
Today was a good day chat
hell yea
As is every day!
You guys gonna be free for some ow tomorrow?
The ow addiction has surfaced
Maybe
My hero academia might actually be peak
This is confirmed
Season 8
Holy shittles
And it’s not done yet
It’s still streaming
Yep
At least two more eps waiting for dub release
What episode is the dub at?
I swear the dubbed episodes come out at the same time though?
Never mind
167 was the last dub
The 2 newest episodes aren’t dubbed
Dude
You need to watch them subbed right now
169 is actually peak
From the title, is it la brava and gentle criminal?
No
They are mentioned at the start of the episode though
Ah
They aren’t being arrested because they helped
Yippee
Trust me dude
Watch the sub
I genuinely think those 2 episodes are some of my favourites in the entire show <This message was edited>
I am not a fast enough reader to keep up w subtitles when there’s action
I don’t mean to patronise you, but how
That part eludes me
How can you not read it fast enough?
The subtitles are not that fast cuh
I see where your confusion comes from, especially with autism favouring written word over spoken, but I’d have to stop tracking the action to read, so I’d end up either constantly pausing or rewinding
I guess it’s kinda like a skill then
Cuz I exclusively watch subbed
So I can just do both
I remember it being a bit more difficult when I started watching anime
And vowed never to watch a dub again
The English voices genuinely disgust me
It hurts my soul to watch it
ESPECIALLY Mushoku tensei
There is one dub I urge you to watch, so much better than any sub
Ghost stories English dub
That is the only one I agree with
There is one exception to my vow
Good
Every other anime though
Sub is better
Every time
Just learn to read cuh <This message was edited>
Join me
(Insert signature look of superiority meme)
But also the required full attention, so I can’t do anything else like work while still understand
Fair enough
But I can’t focus with a show on in the background anyway <This message was edited>
Ah fair
Chat
It happened again
I started watching bocci the rock
And the intro
It’s another song I’ve been listening to for ages
WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING
It’s like every anime I watch uses exclusively songs I already know
Watch more anime till they run out of songs you know?
Mayhaps
I’m gonna find this fuckass song
I have no clue how in gods name I never noticed this
I added this to my liked songs like 2 and a half years ago
Yeah that may give it away
Mayhaps
I’m pretty sure I had watched one or two episodes by then too
I also found like 5 other intros along the way
I found the one from frieren
Spy x family
Oshi no ko
and two from mha <This message was edited>

Work backwards and you’ll get hardly any bookwork checks
Hey guys you know how your parents feel old and tell you they’re older than Google?
Yeah in future we’re gonna have to do that with widespread ai
Today was not a good day
Today was fucking shit
Why?
Ashby decided that period 5 we would be required to stay in our forms and participate in a quiz that involved watching a video that was far longer than it needed to be with horrifically mixed Christmas music and playing “traitors” which I had specifically informed my form tutor I was not interested in doing either. So I was just going to sit there and do my maths homework because that was more pleasurable to me. But no. He had a go at me every time I tried to do something that wasn’t either participating or sitting there in silence.
It has genuinely ruined my day
Uncool
And it doesn’t help that I’m incapable of just saying no and justifying myself
I would’ve happily taken a detention instead
Well im sorry that's happened to you bro
We could kill him if you would like?
And also after my brother gets back from school, I’m also required to go somewhere that my mum has told me I probably won’t like, but she won’t tell me where.
Preferably not
I don’t hate him
Okie then broseph
I just have no respect for him any more
Yeah ashby has a habit of forced joy
THOU SHALT ENJOY

But there were too many signs
Its allowed to be, Turnitin doesn't check if the teacher tells it not to
Yeah I ended up reaching a chat limit trying to regenerate it to reduce those, but like the most major one I plan to mention is the double 0 on the graph, with the rest of the scale inconsistent

Time to start fresh then
No it's not funny
The voice recordings from logan
Complain to meta maybe?
They shouldn't have done anything to your data
Also if you have been doing frequent backups it should be around somewhere
That's my 2 cents atleast
Go to settings > chat > chat backup
I believe it does them weekly by default
they backup by defaukt
so restore shit should be an option
Best of luck sis! <This message was edited>
I dont have any messages from the last month
But I have the important ones
Yippee
It’s so much better than absolutely nothing

Yeah
I’ve just finished constructing the shittest pc possible for £800
For him
About a quarter of that is ram
Tis phucking crazy
That is very expensive
Well
Wills pc was like 50% more than that
But it only has 8gigs of ram
Oh damn
So it’s like mega bottlenecked
Wow
Nice
OMAGAH CHAT, THERES A TRACKILST

Could’ve been either <This message was edited>
But I read it as a direct response to my question
He did also then mention that he wouldn’t be available for the start on the 19th and wished us to have fun
No, that does read to me as probably not cancellled
Anyway
Doesn’t matter now

The UK version came out 2019 and the US version came out 2021
I like both
But already watched the UK version like twice and im just catching up on the new episodes of the US version
Ok fine as long as you’ve seen the good one fully
I saw a clip of the US version on yt shorts and it was the first episode so I checked it out but ended up watching the UK version first 😛
Good, colonialism for the win
Ive made stan watch a lil bit of it too bc school didn't ban BBC iplayer on my laptop
Yippee
Need to watch it
Fuck yeah

Just bad luck ig
Get someone else in the house to be a distraction?

Steal Stan as a distraction

Waiting on my chrome to arrive cuh
Nice pfp dude
Cheers choomba
Put ram in your neck.
That's sick icl
This is muscle contractions and rigamortis

I think a sandy might actually be cheaper now 🙏😭
Chrome aint cheap cuh
Lock tf in and go get a fixer choom

Btw i read the rules and it turns out you can’t use a mechaman smart glove and a grapple hand together
None are accurate
I ain’t baking shit today cus i have work to dooooo
Techscanner?
Yeah only cyberhand options are disabled
How come? Curious btw
You need a minimum of 2 people carrying
🫩
And they'll be put into a bodybag in the bed first
Legally or physically?
So the body wouldn't just be there smelly on your back fr
I think the question is about how the body reacts
Both
unconscious or dead bodies are deadweight and feel a lot heavier than they are
Legally idk, but it’s not too hard to pick up a dead weight person
paramedics aren’t allowed to try and pick up a person alone
Oh
24 hours 2 hours and 3 days
That is correct
Bitch I know it is
Aight calm down
That's in a silly way not mean way
The term “deadweight” had to come from somewhere
men and their need to approve of things people say😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
yall do it hella
What
Do yall not want approval?
Good observation/J
I was answering the question 😭
no..
imagine i’m making the roblox angry sound rn

I hope she's okay
Dw queen i’m the medic/driver/organiser
[Who’s momma T?)
(Momma T is an old woman who worked with me and logan)
(Work mom, her name is Tina)
Nice
But usually that number of cop cars means there's a deceased person in the house
😨
Oh no
Thoughts and prayers for momma T
Is there an ambulance?
I really hope she's okay
Hope shes alr
Didn't see that far but if they're deceased they won't send out an ambulance straight away
Depending on how long they've been deceased
Only a paramedic or doctor can legally pronounce someone deceased however
So they’ll be here sooner or later if thats the case
Ive jus realised that stan and rivers pfp are doing the same pose inverted
How cute
Yeahhhhhhh
Yeah and sometimes they dont come in an ambulance
Ha
Its smiling
That it is!

[18/12/2025, 12:28:13] ceylan:

Blind people? Aiming?
Presenting/pointing from distance?
cats
Exactly, aiding in stealing our Ziggy
oh
he doesn’t like them
he went crazy and got sad
If my future job prospects didn’t have tattoo problems ts would be so tempting
real
I fucking love cyberpunk too much
I bought that game on a whim and now you all have to hear about it
Get to*
im getting back on it tonight fr
You better
continuing with my cutie evil corpo
r u gonna be on
Maybe idk
Still got an assignment to finish
You fell over the edge.. punk
fuck
Me when my mate trips on a curb (i no shit said this in public)
so real
Where the megacities at in real life already
Loughborough is not cutting it
London
dude
did you learn NOTHING from cyberpunk😭😭
Yeah
That our politics are already cooked and we have none of the cool shit
Nothing left to lose, only cyberarms to gain
Then become an exec and make better politics?
Nah i’d rather ride the wave
our politics could be A LOt worse im just saying
like the uk is an absolute shit tip but on the whole most people are free and able to live
we don’t live under an oppressive regime like Afghanistan
we’re not quite terrible yet
I’m not sure how the existence of worse defends terrible
Many people face systemic prejudice from our system and the culture it has created
no yea i get that but our politics isn’t cooked yet thats all im saying
It is most certainly cooked
So what your saying is there’s still work to do
The vast majority of people our age wish to vote in a despotic madman because he makes funny shorts
yea true but at current we don’t live under an oppressive regime and vast majority people live and lead  ordinary lives of their own choosing
like holy shit i hate politicians in our country
but other places have it so much worse
take even america
ice going crazy with ‘illegal immigrants’
Compared to the shoutings against illegals in our own country?
A country which even now is voting against maintaining our inherent rights?
very different to active persecution
again, very different to an active regime
We do not yet have active persecution, but it is not far away
we are pre cooked which means things can still changed
change *
greens are on the rise hella
more popular than labour right now
As are reform
Everyone is more popular than labour right now
untrue
not tories
and lib dem
and your party
current major competitors are green and reform and i’m seriosuly hoping farage gets arrested b4 voting
I really doubt that’s going to happen
yea but a girl can hope
and sign petitions
While i admit we don’t have an actively oppressive regime *yet* we are still living on the edge of that downfall
yurp
We’re being issued britcards, immigration is being cut
the uk is still a marginally much better place to live than majority of the world
Not to mention the terrible cost of living crisis
being gay is still punishable by death in too many countries
It’s not looking too good here either on that front
honest i don’t think they’ll illegalise it but i think hate crime prevention/punishment will be reduced
I’m not saying we’re unsaveable but there is going to have to be a massive flip in the thinking of younger generations
yeppp
part of the reason i wanna be a teacher
Happiest country on planet
i want to mould children to think it’s okay for everyone to exist type shi
And I don’t really see that happening before it’s too late unfortunately
Best country in the world
you would not believe how many gay people i’ve met who’ve had the courage to come out because they had a teacher who wS openly gay
The problem is really that people our age lack foresight or a critical view of politics and are susceptible to whoever makes the funniest campaign speeches rather than actual political promises
definitely
too many people don’t get ‘involved in politics’ holy shit it’s ur future😭😭😭🙏🙏
We are to spread out as a nation
A good quarter live rurally and are unaffected by political action
It’s going to affect us all sooner or later
As in positive political action
The amount of people who just don’t care is shocking
Ikr
Ik many people with horrendous opinions simple because they don’t actually care what happens
Group phds?

i gotta learn how to roleplay a smart character
Smart smart or pretencious smart?
smart smart
which is even worse
Yup
i can do pretentious smart but not real smart
Autism
Dr stone?
Best recommendation
wym
i think i’m just gonna watch a bunch of videos on cybernetics
hopefully fill my brain with the right lingo
Really smart peopld are basically just people who learned to be autistic
They can and will happily talk about there subject for hours on end
But can't stamd people who don't understand it
That's my advice atleast
And it is how i will be playing kjö
What’s kjö?
My character!
Ah
Wait its just kjo
No accent
Ok
Anyone dressing up?
I don't have anything to dress up in
What kind of dressing up?

Only person in the class with full marks
It’s the only assessment I’ve got full marks on
Well in mate
And nobody else did
Today is a good day
Such is life
Well done bro
Sick is life
Thanks
That was autocorrected
But I think I’ll leave it
Sick is life indeed
driving on the motorway with a who i used to play among us with
life is funny
surreal
When i went to my highschool for the last time the middle hq came on <This message was edited>
Sometimes life is just surreal like that
Don’t text and drive
Its mental right?
Like what do you mean my friend of 7 years and I are drinking together in a pub legally
dw i’m not driving x
it’s crazy
Good
Wrapping to the doom soundtrack is crazy, almost just did my secret santas paper inside out
HA
Finally done with an assignment chat
Finally feel done for the year
It’s only due in like 4 and a half hours
But well done nonetheless
Ts was tough man
Been working on it for days
Specially since i had to spend half my time for it working on a different assignment
Yeah that happens, at least they weren’t due on the same day
Thank god for that
In other news all the cards and presents for tomorrow are finally finised
Yippeee
sorry guys imma be turning up empty handed
but none of you guys will be affected ❤️
shit
effected
What happened choomba
not here yet
No you had it right the first time
Ah no harm then
ok good
yurp
Chat you guys are gonna be so cooked in combat
why
Non of y’alls edgerunners are packing any iron
Omfg stan its fine
i am packing a little
i got a smg
I have yet to pick actual gear, rest assured I shall bring both health and harm
Speaking of which @ceylan @Leo @Oscar Hunt Brown @Dakota have you guys fully sorted characters including backstories and gear?
i did that in the session 0
wrote up her shit n shit
and did gear n shit
I didn’t see your gear so i didn’t know
Backstory yes, gear no but shouldn’t take more than like an hour
ya y
Not full backstory but I have a interesting idea for it
Medtech bag no1
You need it
Ive only gotten my secret santa a present bc im poor but what do yall want (crafty shi plz)
I did the same cus imm also pooor
Bracelets/necklaces/decorated shirts?
Up to you, your making it well take what you can give
I'll see what I can do
Done
Tbh not even thought about it these last few days
Btw idk if you did this but paramedic is a much better skill than first aid
I’ll get on it at some point over the next week or so
Its twice as expensive but soooo much better
You’re playing my favourite class so ask any questions, i’ll have answers
Since we’re lacking in iron, I’ll probably bring a solo
Siiiick
I’ll keep some tech essence though in the tech skills maybe
Blades or bullets?
Well
I don’t understand blades yet
So I’d like to discuss that
Cuz blades are sick as fuck
I’ve got a decent amount in both already
I’m gonna do blades defo
They function mostly the same but instead of rolling to the distance chart you have to beat the evasion of your opponent
Sick
I still want to discuss the deets
We got some heat now
Yuh
Punisher 2 type shit <This message was edited>
I got the tech side covered bro dw
Im jack of all trades
Sick
Including lockpicking
I think I’ll do a mercenary who’s paid to stick with you guys
Not sure on how it’d work exactly
I’ll discuss with stan
Can do
Sick
I’m not home rn
Will be in like 10 mins tho
Probs not gonna be able to
Tonight since i’m eepy and wanna rot
But tmr defo can
Ok
@ceylan @Jack Payne @James @Oscar Hunt Brown @William Stothard what (d.i.y) gift do want
Haven't you already got me a gift?
No clue, go crazy
Have I?
I'm a lil eepy
I forfor
The coin you asked from me?
You don’t have to get everyone stuff, you could just turn up and be the present (not in a weird way)
Ah yes
Heheh
Am i right in thinking that your sticking round for yule as well?
There's another present for you too
Indeed
Ill explain when you get it, it's nothing fancy tho
I feel bad now
I omly got you one gift
Don't feel bad cuh
I began charm making tho!
WHEYY
If you wanna charm i can make you one
Ive got snake shed if you ever wanna incorporate that into a piece
[19/12/2025, 19:56:41] William Stothard:
Here's the one made for my mate shreya and dedicated to freyja
I'm gonna make mum a snake shed bracelet 😛
I realised
WOAH
That's so cool!
You remind me heavily of loki's witch wife in myth
Ángrboða
Calling me a witch rn
Yup
Valid
Well her children are a snake a wolf and a goth queen
Oh fuck yeah
I mean they also herald the end of the world but its fine
Im sure yours amd stans kids wont destroy the world
I mean
Depends how hard we rage bait them
If they do, make sure they do it well
Nah my parents rage baited me earlier then high fived when it worked.
What.
They were basically just picking on me when I was frustrated
That's mean wth 🥺
Then said I overreact 😛
Different question
Do we have overlapping gods at all?
Ik you believe in some
Just cant remember hwich
aww surprise me baby
GIYS I JUSR DROVE A CAR BTW
went one second forward and stalled
Yippeeee
i’m wearing crocs 2 sizes too big so i couldn’t feel anything
Congrats!
Honestly im new to the gods part bc I've always been more into witchcraft kinda stuff
Time to take me out 😛
A NEW HAND TOUCHES THE WHEEL
HEHEHEH
YESS
it was terrifying
Appears we both need to work on what the other is good at
Cuz ik fuck all bout witchcraft 😭
Hah stalled out
You feel so short in the seat, right?
More clutch next time
You'll learn over time, I've learnt a little bit over time from my mother so I can ask some more questions for you if you've ever got any
Mate i wouldn't know where to start
Real
I bought citrine crystals tho this week
So slaying
Ooh
Good choice
I mean i gifted them away with the charm 😅
So i domt got them anymore
Still, good choice fr
Aint that your birthstone?
Also w the gods and antigods, its more about understanding their meaning and attachment to how we function as humans
Ik its uniquely associated with freyja tho
Icon
Ive got to make another idol for her as well cuz i gave mine away 😭😭
Freyja is literally the girlboss
FRR
Refused to be wed off to a giant in return for Thors hammer
Isnt married
Freyja is based
I love how she has no kids but is also the godess for fertility
Ig she's both aspects of fertility
But she is also patron goddess of women
Hence 13 is her holy number
Gaslight gatekeep girlboss as a goddess
Indeed
Fuck yeahh
Love 13
The reason is because there is 13 moon cycles in a year
Might need to get into sewing chat
Do it.
And moon cycles are about the same length as menstrual cycles (on average)
Do it
Bro my period was 13 days one day what the flip is she tryna prove 💔
I don't fucking know 💔
Ive had 16 this year
Working overtime
This is why i said on average
Im boutta bring the average up single handedly
For funzies
Dang that’s unfortunate
I’m assuming the plan tomorrow is to go straight from dnd to party?
Indeed more or less
Probs gonna pop into iceland for snacks and shi first

So my assignment i have been working on all week
ya
Submission didn’t fucking register
oh lord
Now i have a late sub
Despite the fact i fucking did it
why don’t you message and explain the situsiton
maybe say your wifi was down last night
and you couldn’t submit it
I’m trying but I’m dealing with dc biggs here
Trained hardass
The thing is tho
Part two got submitted fine
But part 1 didnt?
so explain that bc obvs you did it if you submitted part 2
So i’m gonna leverage that fact to prove i did it
Problem is it’s not the teachers choice, it’s Pearsons
Or whatever board your on
Well she’s seen that the second part went through
And i pulled up the last time i edited my file (which is when i changed the name to submit it) at 19:18
So basically I’m saying that i did in fact do it and that it’s a network problem
NVM CHAT SHE GAVE ME AN EXTENSION

Bet
Yippee
Dam I got you some shiz
Gang what the fuck happened
A drinking game
I had to post a pic of me drinking
Dw it was lemonade
Mostly
video omitted
praying for yall
pace yourself guys i beg
We good
Chilling to a movie
Hurry up
It ran out
Thank you all for tonight, sorry that i crashed out halfway through
Maan it’s only like half 10 ho are yall so tired alreadyyy
Doe anyone know where my headphones are
@ceylan did you take any headphones
i did not
they were on the table when i left
Nvm I found them
good good
Look how they massacred my boy
Your boy did it to himself
He grown
so yall
did you guys learn anything from last night❤️
I learnt that they quit way too early
Nope
Other than more alcohol = more fun
oh good god
Exactly, it was the drunkest I’ve been and some of the most fun without moving
Drink water and don't run off
Also drink doesn't mean the entire fucking thing
Alright so guys i’m all in for some good fun but yesterday was not responsible drinking, i have been informed that if we do that again we will *not* be allowed to do this again
Pace yourselves
Yeah good point, it ran out way too fast
Oh dang we better slow down
You’re all drinking to find limits and that’s not acceptable i’m afraid, a few members of the group and my family were made deeply uncomfortable by all of you
I’m sorry to say this but this is what i have been told
Nah that fair it is your residence you (and will) should be the ones setting rules and limits
Nah actually
It’s not me or my brother
The adults should
It’s my parents
As in Alison and Rob
It's their house fr
Yeah but they can’t communicate that directly unless we’re there, so Stan and Will must act as representatives
Actually stan ive been informed were never having drinking again
generally speaking i set a little rule if im gonna get wasted and its drink only after eating and after about 8/9pm cos otherwise youre gonna die
early
I was told different but i understand
damn yall fucked up hella
We're all to blame here
Oh dang we must have fucked up
All attendees are responsible here
not sure that’s true icl
Damn what did i do?
i think me stan and river were very responsible
That's not my parents opinion
and it was the rest of yall being drunk idiots 💔
What did i do?
Thats what ive been told
I’ll admit me and Oscar were very drunk, but I thought we were doing well staying in one place relatively quiet
What abt me
respectfully im gonna have to disagree it was the 3 very drunken people that were probably at fault
yea mb
James was very responsible
it’s not fair to blame all attendees and alleviate the blame from those who were actually responsible
And he came to a function to the first time and it ended up like this 😭
I don't think so either
Ik im very much to blame
fr
And im gonna stop drinking
Yeah we sorry about this James, we hope you’ll turn up to another function if we’re allowed others
All good nah I'll defo come
Yeah sorry gang this one is on me
And me, I think
Do I wanna knowww?
Hatsune gopniku isn’t real, they can’t hurt you
Hatsune gopniku
sobbing
Whats wrong ceylan
Stan wanna helldive?
Nawb
Still got river over
Cool
How’s Christmas-ing going?
Stan just said gay ass bitch to a cancer patient
I must clarify that i was calling the guy who sung in the spongebob musical a gay ass bitch
Just so happens that the audio was being played over a clip of a cancer patient
Yeah right
Which i could not see
Say that to the cancer patient who was dancing in hospital
Sure sure, play the blind card and the deaf card
Guys look what i found!

I enjoy watching videos about advanced maths and programming more than games and shit
That is peak
video omitted
Chat
Mha might actually be peak
This is cannon
Agreed
The show gets so much better as it progresses
Season 1 is easily the worst
But seasons 4-8
Dear Lord
Absolute cinema
Yep
Have you finished 8 yet?
Don’t like how they do his hair in the latest episodes tho
Cuz the last episode
I’m up to date with the dub, but there are some not yet dubbed
Ok
170 is the last episode
Dude
I just noticed the title of episode 170
“E170 - My Hero Academia”
Oh my god
I’ve just watched 169
Say that again
Yeah that’s gonna be pretty much it
It doesn’t get better than this
This is peak
It’s only downhill from here

the end of that season
Uh
i

I think so
And it only goes uphill from there
Seasons 6, 7 and 8
6? 7?
To say they are fantastic would be an understatement
I've just realised there's 5 cremation caskets in my house that I know of
Crazy shi
Also what time do people usually go to sleep
Normally between 11 and 12
But last night I was up till 2:30
11pm-3am

weekend anywhere from 12-3 and weekdays usually 11/12
but last night it was 4😭🙏😭
12 ish normally but 10:30 (supposedly) on a college night
Real
The latest I've went to bed it like 4pm next day

I wanted ddr5 but it was sold out
I also thought it was a 32 gig set
Unfortunately it was a 16 gig set
either way
a win is a win
But I think the set I saw on Saturday was sold and replaced with this
so you’re building your pc now?
Not yet
Just saw this after dnd last Saturday
ah right right
He is now THE tech
And decided I needed it before it sold out
Cuz the ram market has shat itself
that’s fair fr
It’s mostly insurance though in case I can’t find any ddr5
Cuz like
smart too
In the grand scheme of a £1300 pc, £36 doesn’t make much difference
yeah true
Chat
Could someone get on my ass in like an hour about my room please? I need motivation but I really can't and it's gotten to the point where it's a hazard for myself so I'm tryna force myself but ik damn well I just won't unless other ppl know if that makes sense

Think of the marketing
“Even when the fish had all the water in the ocean to drink, they still chose Heineken”
Just to check games night is still happening next week

Makes sense

BROOO
iM SUCH A PUSSYYYYY
nah lowkey can’t it’s so scary
WHY
I'm sizing up my septum a little bit and mf got me feeling shi
My shivers are being timbered
Some background stuff, should resume in February
Anywho y'all think I'd look good with nose studs?
Is that on the sides of your nose?
Yurr
Ooooh go for it, if it’s not great you can always let them heal back up
River pinned a message
I've had one before but I might redo it 😝
so real
So
Gang
You know my ai I was working on
The stakes are a bit higher now
I’m now also working on a new type of ai
Because generative ai is basically just a really good predictive text engine
And it can’t really handle logical thought
So
I came up with a new way
The idea is that instead of using tens of billions or even trillions of numbers to make matrices to predict things
I make a network of “nodes” that cover and connect different objects and events
I can then build a string of thought that shows how a conclusion was reached
I can reference the possible actions and all the information for each item in the text input
And all of this works with a fraction of the computing power needed for modern language models like Gemini and chatgpt
Because while this can produce a text output, it’s both modular and learns over time
It also can be multimodal in terms of inputs
But then I end up going back to the colossal matrices needed for advanced computer vision and audio recognition
But those are problems for later
The priority is a functional and efficient text engine that can handle logical reasoning and can justify its point
Ooooh fun
hell yeah
I will come back to read that in a moment 😛

This year was a good year, but let us all make the next a better one

Why are the d4’s like that
Wdym

I thought he said 4d's at first
Yeah idk bro I didn't make the shirt
Just found it on Pinterest and thought of yall
That is how some d4 are tho
mine are like that icl
Im bored so here's a riddle:
I roar yet have no mouth, I crack yet have no bones. I appear when things are torn, and rarely do I conform.
What am I?
No clue if its any good
I can't read
Conform
Religion
Crack but ain't got no bones
God to Mary
😨
Nah but genuinely the roar I'm assuming it's not like a tiger and more of a wind kinda roar or smth like that, crack could be something to do with the earth, idk about the torn bit, assuming it's not to do with fabric and to link it to the earth and wind bit I'm assuming a storm?
i’m also thinking something natural
like ice or smth
but what’s that got to do with torn?
maybe it’s a hole guys idk
WAIT
iS IT THUNDER
bc it roars and cracks and it's make sense on why I thought of storm 😛
Please say I'm right, I beg I ain't got a riddle right in ages 🙏
i was lightning before the thunder
THUNDA
at first i thought it was like sewing or like thread or smth but that doesn’t roar sadly
Sewing machine...
They roar but not the others
I thought of the wind because of the roar and I was stumped on the crack and I thought of an earthquake or something like that
It is lightning congratulations
[05/01/2026, 09:46:58] William Stothard:
To explain the torn part, 
Static as a concept is when 2 areas become polar (opposite) therefore when they are opposite they are against each other hence when things are torn
thought static was electrons ?
when one side became negatively charged and one positively charged
wait a fucking minute
that’s opposites
Transfer of electrons yes
grade 7 physics btw
Cool
I got a 6

Gang Minecraft dungeons may have competition
127 today chat!
Who’s on board
Yippee
On my way!
Gang I need to ask a question would anyone be opposed me hosting games night due to the (I have no idea how to spell it) stothards not being able to. I would only be hosting it till they get there things sorted as if anyone wanted to stay over bus roots to dnd may be a problem
It’s just a idea
Any thoughts
if I’m free on the nights sure!
I prolly won't attend icl
What bus is everyone getting home on today?
3:50
Sick
Which stop?
Prolly not this one, next one
radmoor
road
It’s a small 16
Just a warning
I’ll save you a seat

thanks
Not if I steal it first
i’ll sit with u x
😜
how full is it rn stan
Give it up cuh
About a quarter
bruh😭😭
Got you a seat

eyy cheers
so many people here
not everyone getting a seat bryh
is it close?😭
Muscle to the front
Just at ashby square
i shall try
alrigjty
Fixed it 👍
The hype is real chat
ITS SO REAL
Also how’s everyone been?
It’s been oddly quite over the past week
I’m doing great, as usual
shits been crickets bro
good!
But I do need to revise for a maths assessment in a weeks time
Oh shi yeah I got maths to do too
I was reorganising my bag and realised how much I’ve actually learned over the last few months
It’s fine it’s due to next week
Yippee
Yuh
Gimme a sec
I’m glad everyone else has been enjoying having a life, from how little people have been on since like Christmas
Yeah
I think I remember most of it
But I’m gonna revise it anyway
Cuz further maths is hard as fuck
And complex numbers is by far the hardest topic we’ve done so far
I’m so glad further maths is optional for my lot
Considering it requires at least an 8 in maths, I’d guess so
I think my 2 favourite topics are calculus and algebraic methods
Today I learned how to calculate the roots and the inverse of any quadratic or cubic equation
Next week I’m gonna do quartics
I hope the snow continues all night so I can escape physics tomorrow
I should figure out what I do and don’t know in physics
Cuz I’ve not really been taking notes
I’ll talk to Gemini
The snow continuing is great, but Loughborough won’t tell us if they’re closed till roughly 6:30 so we’ve still got to be up anyway
I don’t usually get up until at least 7:30
I’d probably get an email before or around then
Unfortunately that’s when our bus leaves Coalville
Ah
That’s unfortunate
Anyone up for Overwatch?
I want to talk to someone other than Leo for a bit
I’ll be on discord
I would, but Charlie has claimed me for the night
Ok cuh
We don’t need a report this time fr
Nah I’m gaming on call to her, Outer worlds 2
I only get to see her once every couple months anyway

Chat, My wallpaper has changed yet again <This message was edited>
Peak is here
It took way too long to convince Gemini to make this
And if I hadn’t told you Gemini made it, you’d never have known
Cuz the cover art for patchwork is amazing, but too small for a wallpaper
took away my like so fast
I figured
If it helps, it’s only half ai
It’s majoritively real
I think this is a good use of ai images tbh
Rather than producing shitty images, I’m just using it to adapt an existing one to a different format
yea slightly better tbf
the cover art looks sick tho fr
Yuh
Go listen to it please
It’s so peak
I’m genuinely considering spending the £10 to buy the full album on Bandcamp
do it
Mayhaps
But I’m trying to save for my pc
And I’ve already spent around £50 out of that

Important discovery chat
The 1x32GB ram prices are not only surprisingly stable, but also priced similar to 1x16 and even some 1x8 kits
The 1x32s have been weirdly unaffected by ramageddon
The 1x32 kit I’m gonna get is at least £100 cheaper than its 2x16 counterpart and has stayed at this price for the last few days
Which is better than I can say for the 2x16s
So far the 1x8s and the 2x16s seem to have been hit the hardest
1x16 is pretty bad
And 1x32 is the best of all of them
I’ll come up with equivalent value later
But 32gigs in 4x8 would be more expensive than 2x16 which is also more expensive than 1x32
That makes no sense, yet all the sense
Yeah
So I’ve managed to save £100 on ram
Although with a performance hit since motherboards are designed to work with 2 sticks
So 1 isn’t as fast as the motherboard can handle
But this gives me the flexibility to upgrade to 64 gigs later
Yippee
anyone getting on the 3:50?
Nah i wont get out in time
I’ll be on the 4:50
damn
Biggie cheese

My mom is on the verge of a warpath that will bury ibstock school
Great
What’s happened now? <This message was edited>
Basically 
Mrs Fox left at the start of this year. And with her went all of my brother’s considerations
She actually did something besides being a twat?!?
My mom emailed about this after going in for a talk to get the consideration put back in place 
It’s been 5 weeks since then and still nothing
Sounds about right
Well she was a pastoral lead and she was very much a don’t take shit from anyone person
She was a pastoral lead?!?
How the fuck did that happen?
Last year for year 7
Ah
But now
My mom is going to get documentation for the considerations my brother had at the junior school from the junior school. 
And if shit doesn’t start happening, she’s gonna start steam rolling up the chain of command until something does
I see
Good plan
I would say good luck to Ibstock
But I don’t think I want to
Luck won’t save them
Chat Im lowkey really psyked for all the upcoming tabletop stuff
Hell yeah

Guys something about walking in the rain while listening to "A lifetime of war" and hearing that ghostly chorus of men singing about dying in war makes me so incredibly sad yet so incredibly proud to be human

Yippee
so gang
for the last week ive been trying to make a minecraft modpack
and im curios if any of you are interested
if so i have a mod list
My good chum
I no longer possess a personal device capable of running shi
Also strange question to all
Hwæt?
But do you ever get it where you just lose your rythmn?
Wdym?
Musically or in life?
Like that internal feeling of joy and want to move sing and dance
I only usually get that when listening to music and it’s infrequent then
Zamn fair nuff then
This may seem obvious and therefore useless, but when I get that listening to music tends to cure it
Something upbeat and fast usually
I find that finding new music helps
Yeah im just not in the mood for my usual music
My favourite tend to stagnate quite quick sometimes <This message was edited>
Yeah i getcha
Anyone got any good song recommendations to get my blood pumping?
I don’t really have any for that
But I do have some that are more of a chill, but like, still rhythmical
Kinda thing
Idk how to describe it
Yeah nah i get ya
Send it me on spotify broski
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6yk9c5eD4FzF17r2IYajSg?si=gk5x0ZZmTPKWcHijU-eGkg&pi=pqK0RvYRRg-wO
No specific song, but a nightcore version is often good, my go to is Gossip, sometimes Rockefeller street or I have a metal version of Caramelldansen
My favourites atm are stupid heart and in these moments
Oscar you sexy man this is absolutely what I need
All good bro
YEASS ICE BEEN PLAYING
MODDED THIS WHOLE WEEK
Unfortunately I’ll still be pc-less for about a month more
Just got on the 127 cus the 16 looked like a no show but then it turned up as we left, so we got off at the library and got on the 16
10/10 would recommend
This is how you game the system
I did that the other way round once
You intentionally made your day worse?
The 16 was full
I was standing
So i got off and then on the 127
Ah worth it
Alr bet I’ll send it when I get home
awesome
Cool fucking question that Gemini gave me
Find the repeated root and find the range of values of k for which the equation has real roots
Your being very fancy, then there’s kids in my class pretending to whip each other with charging cables and belts
Sounds entertaining
And I get to leave a whole lesson early
Today is a good day
Today is a good day indeed <This message was edited>
C'est la vie 🙏
Also finally finished geo coursework

Can end it all finally
What was it on?
I decided to investigate the effect of plant pests and diseases on the rate of carbon uptake in local tree species like corsican pine, native ash and douglas fir (which I used as a substitute for corsican pine in some cases) <This message was edited>
You can read the investigation if you would like
Or you can read the excel spreadsheet usef to calculate it
Also @Stan you got any scran bro, I wasn't able to pack lunch today

Real
Anyone else interested
Nah I’ve got nothing that can run mods
gang i got both my offers for uni
Hell yeah
I did a 3 hour programming exam today
Sounds like party time
I got to solder for an hour and a half straight
Nice
(Question 2 btw)
brah what the fuck is allat yap
An explanation for an encryption algorithm by shuffling cards
That I had to program
And I was so fucking close to finishing
How long do you get?
3 hours for 3 questions
That wasn’t the hardest question
Question 1 was
And I’ve realised after re reading it that pretty much nobody is gonna get any marks for the first one
Cuz the fucking coordinates are centered in the bottom left corner rather than the top left
That one question would probably take me the three hours
The way I did it literally cannot produce the outputs I need
My mum was telling me to read the question
Like I didn’t fucking try
Congratulations!
What the shit
Guys
I just grabbed my phone out my pocket
And was confused when the screen was black
Our grade 9 student ladies and gentlemen, congratulations
No
So
I have an expensive phone
I’m used to it having “always on diplay” which means I can still see the time and notifications even when the display is off
I fucked my battery today so I’m at 20% now on low power mode
LPM reduces the refresh rate, disables always on display and reduces the processor’s available power
Until this year, AOD was limited to pro iPhones (14 and newer)
So my privileged ass was confused when it wasn’t on
Cuz my phone very rarely drops below 20% <This message was edited>
Damn I didn’t even know that was an iPhone feature
Nobody here except me has a phone recent enough to have heard of it
Let alone use it
That’s a lie
Jack has an iPhone 15
You deleted this message.
Damn I thought I was the only one with an older phone
guys i’m getting the 17 next month btw
Sick
or as soon as i go looo at one to inspect
Best value iPhone rn imo
think i’ll go to o2 after college
but i want it in time for concerts n stuff for better quality
Wait a couple months, the 18 comes out and the 17 prices will drop
Bro
That’s 8 months away
true but i’m getting it on contract upgrades anyways
Tf you mean in a few months
Fair
Literally 2/3 of a year
Yeah that’s only a few
Gotta be over 10 at least to be more than a few months
8 months doesn’t count as a few
3 months does
4 is the boundary
Nah it’ll be the new school year in a couple months
It’s not
yeah ur rift
right
it’s only 3 months left
and then summer
Yah
It’s gonna go way too fast
yuppp
If we use your argument for a “few” then if you don’t buy the most recent iPhone by Christmas, you may as well wait until the next one
Exactly
that makes no sense
Just get the phone and don’t worry about it
Plus the newest one isn’t usually great
Generational differences are marginal
It doesn’t matter which, they’re both insane compared to a 13
But also, camera design hasn’t been great for a while
What do you mean?
The specs might be wonderful, but the design isn’t
I much prefer the 11-16 pro design to the 17 pro
Although there are many advantages to the larger unit
whic is better camera quality whilst still being pretty similar to 13
It doesn’t matter though, cuz ceylan isn’t getting a pro
Yeah
wym
i may
cos i like a big phone
The only difference between it and mine is that mine can do 5x and raw photos
right
(The pro ain’t bigger) <This message was edited>
alrighty
so
which phne
16 or 17
normal
Wdym?
is most similar whilst having good quality
They are both very similar phones
Actually
That’s just straight up a lie
It’s the biggest generational change of any iPhone
Get the 17
what’s the differences between 16 and 17
It’s basically a reskinned 16 pro
Higher refresh rate, marginally better camera, much better front camera, bigger battery, always on display
idk the features of any of them icl
hmm
Those are the main ones that I remember
the always on display isn’t smth i fw
It’s a setting bro
It’s off by default I think
And I can confirm that it is honestly on par with the 120Hz display
I couldn’t get a phone without those 2 now
right right
i’ll have a gander today and i’ll lyk
If the decision is between the 16 and 17, get the 17
You won’t regret it
The 16 is more similar to the 13 you have than it is to the 17
right
Anything else you’d like to know?
Also you’ll need a usb-c cable for either (you get a c to c cable with the phone)
But if you don’t have a plug that takes c, you either need a new plug or cable
What’s the wireless charging like on the newer phones?
Exactly the same as it is in the phones you guys have, except that if you spend £50 on apple’s magsafe charger it goes marginally faster
I would highly recommend investing in a MagSafe case and charger
lowkey i’ll ask once i see
Ok
can’t think of any rn but i will
Filthy sinners
Why y searching David Attenborough
Making sure he's still with us
Also why not, he's a legend
Why is David giving you sin?
He's not🫩
David would never sin
I mean I know older men and all that, but he’s too pure
River i think we're a bit past being called sinners

Yo guys
Yo
I drew someone digitally because I remembered I have free will
Thats sick cuh
Also the tunnel in queens park has like the perfect frequency for singing in
Shits majestic
That’s so cool
Thank you cuh 😛🙏
Hell yeah
WAIT THIS IS AWESOME
I ALDO LOVE THAT DUDE AONMUCH
people make so much art of him
and he’s so cool
i follow him on insta
FR SAME
I only followed him on there today tbf... I don't know what platform I was originally following him on
he has a few accounts dw
think his current one is a new one cos his last got banned
Ahh
but you’re drawing is actually so sick bro
Makes sense on why I couldn't find him straight away on my following 😭
Ayy thankyoiiiuuuh
i got this book right
to read as a sort of romantasy filler
knowing it’d be a bit of an easy read
Ooh
but holy shit it’s buns
like i’ll carry on cos im hopeful
but man…
😔
If it's bad then abuse the book
the plot is a sick concept but it’s just so poorly written
might have to
Use it in cool crafts
Good idea, we have plenty of lighters between the group
Make me a paper rose ong
Sounds like it’s fanfic time
Give me a page and I'll smoke it
Holy ball
That was fucking sensual icl
You ate them?
That's becoming a daily snack
That is cheap tbf
exactly my thoughts
the beginning of my week was consumed by a 250k word fanfic
read it in 2 days
guys this book is NOT getting better
but i just paid a fucking tenna for it😭😭
Dont keep reading it?
Keep it as a Christmas/birthday gift?
it’s lowkey a fraction of the size of fanfics i’ve read though
Sounds like youll just get more upset the further you go into it
maybe i just touch it out
yeah true
the cover is so pretty so atleast it’s not a total waste
tough*??
Rip it off, frame it, bin the book
u might be onto something
My wisdom knows no bounds
Anyhow imma touch a book of literal all evil
I don’t think Ben was actually prepared for you to succeed on the roll to detect it
Uh no he knew I would
Bro knew full well I would succeed
Is anyone awake
Yuh
Yello
Hi
Wassup?
The ceiling
I'm just bored
Fair
I’m gonna go have breakfast in a min
I'm meant to be going to an open day to the college I'm hoping to move to and mums ill so I can't go😔
Oh
That’s unfortunate
Yea
Happened the last few times too
Man
Is there another before the end of the year?
aw unlucky that
No idea yet
literally,  ur a wise character he knew damn well

[25/01/2026, 11:54:26] William Stothard:
Just had this fucker pierce my foot
Oof
Oh damn that’s big
Indeed
That’s also what she said
You have AIDS now
I made a pointless 3:3 line adapter for my pointless giga generator that I can’t afford to run
I can’t show you the generator cuz it’s too big to fit on the screen and most of it is empty space because of all the splitters
Surely there’s an easier way, like a 1:1
Yep
I could’ve done that
I need 3 lines and I’m giving it 3
It’s cool, but only useful if one source dries up really
But instead of just doing that, I’m splitting each line 3 ways and then merging those thirds
That’s the neat part
They all pull from the same source
So they’re all on or they’re all off
Also this uses like 5 times as many batteries as I make
Now make one that does 4:3
Ok
So
That’s completely pointless
Yep
I did 3 because 2 couldn’t provide enough batteries
Each line gives me 30/min
And I need (funnily enough) 67/min
Which is more than the 60/min of 2 lines and less than 90/min from 3 lines
Silence
Stfu bitch
Anyway
4 would literally do nothing
And also I can’t actually get 4 where I’m doing this
So it sounds to me like you now need to go 6:6
**sigh**
It took long enough to do this with access to blueprints
And so the factory expands
To do that, it’s bigger than the space I can place blueprints
So I’d have place the majority of things by hand
And also that’s about twice this size
So I’d need the same amount of space as 4 of these
So it’s also much less efficient
But needs less lines than 4 of these
Ok hear me out, verticality
Unfortunately not a thing in arknights
Damn
Onto the next source I guess
Huh
Because of the new character?
Bit late then
Been about 2 months too late
Hello chat.
Good morning gang
How is everyone this fabulous morning
Today is gonna be another great day
Indeed indeed
Mother is still ill howevee I be doing my thing

Absolutely all of my work is done, so now I basically just doubled my lunch and get to leave a whole lesson early
C'est la vie!
Bros, I wanted to go to this hotel (mum told me to look at some) and I didn't know why, it's some Hall manor thingy and it has a spa, so cool right?? no idea why I keep coming back to it AND IT'S EXTREMELY FUCKING HAUNTED APPARENTLY

I formally retract all statements affirming A level superiority
And would like to formally apologise

While everyone was excited about artificial intelligence, you forgot about natural stupidity

https://youtu.be/z2q23CtnqUA?si=BjfK7Qu2MUkfKes4 new warbond
And it looks fun
Lots of explosives
And laser shotgun
And shield grenade
And a belt fed grenade launcher
Comes under explosives
But in that case
Boom hammer
And hellbomb launcher too
I want to know what the armour passive is
Does the hammer boom?
Yes
It explodes
With enough force to one hit hulks
Holy shit
It also must be reloaded
Which I think is fun
You need to replace the head each time
A small price to pay
Indeed
I wonder how many heads we can carry
I wonder if arrowhead will allow it to count as melee damage? <This message was edited>
Probably
One can hope
The passive will probably be something for better explosions or  explosions resistance, in th style of inflammable
Or
Extra munitions for explosive weaponry
True
Might be for the hammer specifically, named head hunter
I doubt that
They wouldn’t make an armour set for a melee weapon
Good point
Ooh what about an ammo catcher type thing that gives a chance to use explosives/explosive ammo without expending them
I don’t think they’d do that
That seems very difficult to do
And have be semi realistic at the same time
If it explodes, that’s it, it went boom
You can’t get the ammo back
Cuz it exploded
Ik your right, but one can hope
I found the passive
What is it?
Called supplementary adrenaline, taking damage restores stamina
Not bad
I fuck with it
Definitely good for running on high diff bot missions
I think imma stick with siege ready for the siege breakers
Same probably
I’ll probably try it though
Seems like my thing
And the shield nade is just a throwable bubble
But imma need the light version
Which is not in the warbond
Yup
Can’t wait
Which means you can be triple bubbled alone
Yeah
Glorious evening
I love you all so much
It's crazy that we're all alive at the same time
I agree, I was in a mood to make some (non-physical) bad decisions, but I’m glad I didn’t bc you guys are all I need
Real shit dude
You guys mean everything to me
Hope you feel better now/soon
Yeah sleeping helped loads
Damn you
You could’ve been quiet
I was gonna write some shit
And now I’m not
Write it write it write it
No
Maybe later

Fin woah
I'm happy you're not dead yet
The spiders haven’t got him yet!
Thanks for answering the call guys
Made my day
I wasn’t feeling too good, that’s why I went out and called
It’s really weird feeling that way, but also knowing that by the next morning you’ll be over it
The night is bright
I love you guys
C'est la fucking vie bro, we love you to
Who’a aboard the 127 today?

Ho'way!
Guys, even tho I missed the  college open day, I found a teams meeting that's TODAY to talk about living there and courses 😛
I forgot that I have free will
Party timee
Yippee
We got the top front

Opinions on geocaches
Fun, but unrewarding alone

[28/01/2026, 08:31:01] Fin: Hey guys, I won’t be able to talk for a bit because Tom banned me again, I’ll let you know when I get unbanned again.
okay stay safe dude have fun in the upside down
Okay dude, love ya loads
Best of luck mate!
Does anyone else get a feel of ruin in your stomach and constant thoughts of death
occasionally baddie but stay safe love you
Idk how to make it stop tho
It's been like 3 straight days
Tad random
So lil confused
You good dude?
Yeah I'm good
If you wanted to rant to me ever queen feel free but I can’t give any comprehensive responses rn cos of class but my dms are always open
I find eating and sitting outside admiring beauty, not thinking about much kinda helps just taking a break from stress
Yeah but I can't just not think of anything, I'm always thinking of something
And unfortunately the past few days my brain has decided that it's gonna be the fear of dying and becoming nothing once again and having to start over
I find that music helps with not thinking
If you want some recommendations, I can give some
Yes please 🙏

Will is a great guy to talk to for putting a positive spin on that, but I’ll try my best. Becoming nothing and starting anew is part of the great beauty of the endless universe, you get to become anything and everything, you can become someone totally different and no one will hold anything against you for it. Think about the rolling hills and the trees, the animals that roam them. The trees that saw the dinosaurs power our cars now and we thank them for it. When we are gone we will help the planet by giving our bodies to the earth. The stars care not for your actions, and that in itself is beautiful.
Such is life
Such is life
Just lost my fuckass headphones
Maaann
I put them down for one second I swear💔😔
Time to find a speaker
Where was the last place you saw them
Mums extremely ill and dads in bed
On my head.
Oh
How did you lose them then?
They'll pull up at some point it's gucci
Ok
Idfk
Hope sooner rather than later
Hopefully 🙏
Clean the room till you find them?
How about
Procrastinating for 6 hours
Procrastinate thinking by cleaning
Death should not be feared, death is that mothering figure who comes to take all pain away and lay you to rest, she cares for you and loves you dearly. At least that is how my belief interprets death
And life is fleeting, one should always live like its your last day
Baring in mind the law n all
Might just go insane icl
Crazy how many paths one can take
Nah why bother
Could end up famous in 10 years or in an asylum
Says the narc
CHAT IM AMAZING! OVERALL JAG HARSKÄR! 🇸🇪 Everyone voted for my resolution at MUN. I might just be the jon Sweden
Hell yeah

Sardines here I come
Grim

Balances each other out
Kachow
And like
Yolo innit
But do I put the chocolate on the pizza slice?
I did 3 pages of pshe work be proud everyone (threat btw)
No you soggy breadstick
Individually
Getting both is not sustainable btw money is expensive
Money is temporary
Splurge a lil
It won't matter in 5 years so do it 🙏
Tragedy 😭
The pizza place ran out of pizza and the chocolate place is closed
Get a drink then
I already got Dr Pepper
Hell yeah
That dos not make up for it

Guys
I’m trapped in a mental limbo rn
I want to go to bed, but don’t want to go into my room
why
Hard to put it
Do you want solutions to the room or to sleeping arrangements?
But I’ve basically just lay there pointlessly for hours over the last few days and I felt like shit and I went out last night to see the stars and spoke to Fin and it was epic and today I did awesome shit like actually working on my NEA and did all of my homework and my room just feels like a pit of hopelessness and despair almost rn
Easy temporary solution or harder long term solution?
Give me both, as usual I’ll probably be over it by tomorrow
Easy solution, find somewhere else to sleep for the night (sofa etc)
Hard solution, music on, carb snack, maybe energy drink/caffine and clean the room
i know it’s lowkey crazy but a good wank puts me right to sleep
put some white noise on and boom
asleep like a baby
It’s not about sleep
It’s that I don’t want to be in my room rn
ah right
yeah maybe just hijack the sofa tonight and see how you feel tomorrow
I’ll end up doing one of those 2
I’m on the sofa rn
But I may clean my room
Unfortunately the effects of finishing on a man compared to a woman are almost completely opposite, males tend to feel more energised and active afterwards bc huntergather hormones to prevent starving by fetching food
damn
Lowkey jealous
that’s actually so sad for you guys
I’m gonna have to hard disagree there buddy
LMAOOO
Imma clean my room
post nut bed time
Found my dice again
hell yeah
maybe change your sheets
give yourself
like a refresher
Roll to clean your room
it always makes me feel very cosy
nah cos lowkey have you seen the dnd chore charts
Such a fun idea but I would just reroll if it was one I didn’t like <This message was edited>
This is real shit
This is sadly also real 🫩
I reorganize my room when it feels like that
Get some marbles and put 1 in the jar per task you do. 
I like doing that, it makes stuff fun.
i need to rewatch the captian america’s man
and maybe the early avengers stud

i don’t need someone else to message for me to message😭😭

Halp
Someone just rung the doorbell a ton and belted on the fckn door
We ain't expecting anyone rn
😨
Grab a large object you can hit someone with (bat etc), and knock on the door back
Nah
If anything happens I'll just hit them then
Bark at them
Just ignore them ong
Bet
If it’s the police they’ll call you ong
Could be a delivery?
Nuh uh
They knock on the door and say plz take your son back its the third time this week and it's still Monday
You don’t have to answer the door unless they have a warrant
Yeah they can keep the son
Also why are you acting like I don't know ts
I’m not trying to say you don’t know
I’m providing information to the group at large
Know your rights ong
Fr
What's y'all opinion on beauty pageants?
horrific and  hate them
Just posing a question from debate club wanting to hear opinions
Depends
horrific impact to girls self esteem and the mentality of worth
I like the cat ones
And the dog ones
They should do reptile ones
this one i can stand by
So yeah i think we .eant human ones
Why
Its an interesting topic
Which side do you want ong
I can go either way
You don't have to debate I just wanted to know the opinions of others
I don't agree with them as they hold a standard that isn't realistic and also show toxic relationships between family and friends as 'normal'
To what extent do you believe they rely on the clothes they wear and the figure of the person wearing them?
(another question from debate)
They believe that the clothes they wear hold power to getting what they want and need, this is extremely unhealthy and proposes a way of life that isn't realistic
Idk bro I'm multitasking rn
Its all good i am just curious
The fact that certain pageants have become embedded within the cultures of families leading to a culture of what i can only call abuse is disgraceful
Not to mention the impossibly high standards which can be placed on children as young as 5
Also other news
I purchased solo of fortune 2045 so if y’all wanna hit really big leagues then it’s an option
Wonderful opinions all of you
Glad to see we are all homogenous in opinion
I had to defend them cuz I voted for banning them 🫩

Ayy
Reminder to all that you can all vote right now
Amd you should register
Reminder to leave me alone
Imma just saying
Change comes from action
You at college?
Reorganised my desk
Hell yeah
And learning JavaScript p5
Hell yeah
I’m trying to work out how to use vectors to create a line of motion
To get a circle to move from a to b
(a is the top left corner and b is the bottom right)
Girl I'm a failing year 11 I don't understand any of that
Broski
Ts is simple as fuck in concept
Don't even 😭
Literally all im trying to do
I am returning soon
But p5 uses their own data type for vectors so I can’t use normal mathematical operations for it
I have to use p5’s built in functions
And they aren’t as nice
OK there are some really cool functions for vectors
That are incredibly useful
The Python-rot is crazy
I can’t stop typing print when I want to output a value
So instead of fixing it, I made a function called print that outputs the value I enter
In the nicest way possible, nerd
Ok?
Well done, you were stubborn enough that you made life easier
I managed to get the vector stuff working btw
So I’m trying to get it to bounce off the borders now
It’s not working :(
But you will have to port that into every script you write in future
Yep
I’ll just rewrite it, it’s not too hard
Give it bounds and generate a random angle within those bounds to redirect?
I figured out why it wasn’t working
Print already exists
And js doesn’t like me overwriting its functions
Will it let you if you try hard enough?
No
I just renamed it
Oh
I worked out why I was getting an error
I was using a vector function on a single part of the vector
Since it’s just a number, I can use normal operators
And vector functions won’t work
Because (funnily enough) it’s not a vector
Ah
It’s still dying
Uh oh
I know why it’s getting stuck
Basically
It will always go through (0,0) cuz it a direct line
And all of my conditions are then true at (0,0)
So it doesn’t know what to do and gets stuck
Oh cool so a simple offset should fix it
I don’t intend to offset it
I’ll work something out when I get back
@James what are these?
Nuggets 😂
Mhmmm
Share?
No
Mine
Back off
Meanie
me writing in favour of christianity during my gcses 😭😭😭
me having to write that macbeth is not actually a dick during my gcses😭😭😭
You know you didn’t have to? You can choose to write against if you want
nah but sometimes you can only think of things you disagree with
That’s fair
Holy shit why is maximillien from OW so cold?
"I remember what it was like to toil in silence while watching unworthy fools sit in a palace forged from luck and the labour of others"
aura
anyone else pleasantly drunk rn
Art thou?
Splendiferous
Enjoy yourself then my good chum
shall do
I’ve basically just spent an hour and a half trying to work out why in the flying fuck my code isn’t working on Leo’s pc
I’ve managed to find the longest error I have ever seen and genuinely cannot decipher it combined with the source code I’m trying desperately to comprehend
Any luck yet?
He decided to sleep before I could fix it
I’m waiting for training to finish for my gpt
I’m trying a different data set
But I’ll probably train it on a few
Cuz they’re different styles
And the language used in this one doesn’t seem like it works great for this
Could you export this chat and upload it to learn from? Giving it a variety of linguistic styles to read and understand
That’s a fucking amazing idea
I don’t think I can
Not sure how it’d cope with the pictures and gifs
Because WhatsApp’s encryption is lowkey crazy, but I will investigate
I’d have to filter through it for those
There’s a button to export chat which downloads it as a text pdf I think, with option to include images or not
There’s a setting turned on in here that prevents it
Just tried exporting it
Ah advanced chat privacy
Yeah
Don’t forget all the absolutely devious shit we’ve said
Your ai could probably go without it
Varied dataset dude
I wouldn’t train it off of purely this
It wouldn’t get much useful info from it
I’d use some of the other text files I have with it
Once you have the text file downloaded, you could theoretically skim through yourself to filter out the particularly devious parts
Yeah
I’ll try exporting it after I turn it off, then I’ll turn it back on
