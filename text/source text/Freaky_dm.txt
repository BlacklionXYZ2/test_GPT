[17/06/2025, 13:30:18] Dakota: I can’t work out if carrot would suit the sword of thrones command better or a crystal sword bc shiny
[17/06/2025, 13:30:45] William Stothard: Thrones command obviously
[17/06/2025, 13:31:18] Dakota: But the crystal does a flat d8 extra on any hit compared to a +1
[17/06/2025, 13:31:53] William Stothard: Thematic over power hear mate
[17/06/2025, 13:32:02] Dakota: True true
[17/06/2025, 14:02:26] Stan: Plus his royal sword is notably inert in terms of magic
[17/06/2025, 14:02:32] Stan: Its a defining trait

[26/06/2025, 16:12:11] William Stothard: Do not mention that film around here
[26/06/2025, 16:12:24] Leo: Ya like jazz
[26/06/2025, 16:16:21] William Stothard: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
How should I start it? "You like jazz?"

[26/06/2025, 18:31:04] Stan: Is that what she told you mate?
[26/06/2025, 18:31:17] William Stothard: Nah that's what the homes told me bro

[26/06/2025, 21:28:59] Dakota: Not my fault I was being briefed for the parade this weekend
[26/06/2025, 21:29:10] Dakota: He can see it in the morning
[26/06/2025, 21:37:23] Stan: Damn
[26/06/2025, 21:37:30] Stan: Briefings
[26/06/2025, 21:37:41] Stan: The bane of the gung ho cadet
[26/06/2025, 21:39:37] Dakota: It’s not like I listen, it’s the same armed forces as it is every year
[26/06/2025, 21:40:09] Stan: Yep
[26/06/2025, 21:40:15] Stan: Its the same thing every year
[26/06/2025, 21:40:23] Stan: But somehow the briefing gets longer
[26/06/2025, 21:40:41] Dakota: They have actually changed something this year, they decided to plan for the heat
[26/06/2025, 21:40:50] Dakota: But I think they went a little over the top
[26/06/2025, 21:41:03] Dakota: We’re allowed to do 15 mins work for 45 mins rest
[26/06/2025, 21:41:15] Stan: Jesus
[26/06/2025, 21:41:28] Stan: Was the enforced drinking not enough?
[26/06/2025, 21:41:37] Stan: Or the cooldown PT?
[26/06/2025, 21:41:43] Stan: The cadet forces have fallen
[26/06/2025, 21:41:48] Stan: Millions must be hazed
[26/06/2025, 21:42:10] Dakota: We didn’t get no cooldown pt, we just get released like feral animals
[26/06/2025, 21:42:35] Stan: Damn we had to do a PT run
[26/06/2025, 21:42:49] Stan: Now that i think about it i think the staff was just a masochist
[26/06/2025, 21:43:13] Dakota: Ha
[26/06/2025, 21:43:29] Stan: But
[26/06/2025, 21:43:34] Stan: Atleast we did something
[26/06/2025, 21:43:55] Dakota: We get to watch each other faint and have to be told not to just step out the way
[26/06/2025, 21:44:23] Stan: Damn you don’t catch em?
[26/06/2025, 21:45:00] Dakota: Only when ordered
[26/06/2025, 21:45:30] Stan: We’ve always had atleast one cadet collapse
[26/06/2025, 21:45:53] Stan: Just like
[26/06/2025, 21:45:56] Stan: Catch him
[26/06/2025, 21:46:15] Dakota: We just have repeat offenders
[26/06/2025, 21:46:36] Stan: Yeah its usually the same guy
[26/06/2025, 21:47:08] Dakota: It’s also great when we have more than a single member of staff from our squad
[26/06/2025, 21:47:44] Stan: Honestly these big events always get overplanned
[26/06/2025, 21:47:57] Stan: And in spite of that they still don’t go to plan
[26/06/2025, 21:48:13] Dakota: There’s a plan?
[26/06/2025, 21:48:34] Stan: Sometimes
[26/06/2025, 21:51:12] Dakota: And that’s just when it’s a single branch, multi force just gets worse
[26/06/2025, 21:53:03] Stan: Don’t forget the post op scraps
[26/06/2025, 21:53:16] Stan: Can’t let them air casets walk off without a good ass whoopin
[26/06/2025, 21:53:37] Dakota: Bet I usually got my spikes in my pockets
[26/06/2025, 21:54:11] Stan: Ik a kid who read your entire basic training syllabus so he could quote it incorrectly
[26/06/2025, 21:54:23] Stan: Army cadets are the pettiest shits i have ever met
[26/06/2025, 21:54:45] Stan: Anyway goodnight all
[26/06/2025, 21:56:03] Dakota: Night

[26/06/2025, 22:05:08] Dakota: Then stop playing one of the worst shooters ever
[26/06/2025, 22:05:25] William Stothard: Bro how about you stop being such a fucking redditer
[26/06/2025, 22:05:38] Stan: *redditor

[26/06/2025, 22:10:44] Stan: Cyberbully a cripple /J
[26/06/2025, 22:10:52] Dakota: Yahoo
[26/06/2025, 22:10:59] William Stothard: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.

[07/07/2025, 00:31:01] William Stothard: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
How should I start it? "You like jazz?"

[07/07/2025, 00:42:01] Stan: Slight spelling error
[07/07/2025, 00:42:06] Stan: Opinion invalid
[07/07/2025, 00:42:07] Dakota: A taste of your own medicine
[07/07/2025, 00:42:23] Stan: We share a mother
[07/07/2025, 00:42:30] Stan: Tad bit rude innit

[07/07/2025, 00:43:31] Dakota: Yap tf away
[07/07/2025, 00:43:45] Stan: I’m just gonna say it
[07/07/2025, 00:44:01] Stan: Montagne is kinda outdone by literally every other shield op
[07/07/2025, 00:44:15] Dakota: Ultimate protection tho
[07/07/2025, 00:44:30] Stan: At the cost of doing fuck all
[07/07/2025, 00:44:43] Stan: Bro sits in the corner “waiting to strike”
[07/07/2025, 00:44:57] Stan: Plus you can just melee him and he fucking dies
[07/07/2025, 00:45:05] Stan: Blitz can flash you
[07/07/2025, 00:45:14] Stan: And blackbeard has a rifle
[07/07/2025, 00:45:27] Dakota: But Blackbeard’s ads time is shit
[07/07/2025, 00:45:37] Stan: Fuze is arguably worse but he isn’t a dedicated shield op
[07/07/2025, 00:45:38] Dakota: I always get immediately headshot
[07/07/2025, 00:45:50] Stan: He can dive through windows without dropping his shield tho
[07/07/2025, 00:45:53] Dakota: Fuze shouldn’t be in a place where he needs a shield
[07/07/2025, 00:46:01] Dakota: True
[07/07/2025, 00:46:11] Stan: Yeah the cluster is better used through walls
[07/07/2025, 00:46:24] Stan: He shouldn’t be rushing like any other shield should
[07/07/2025, 00:46:44] Stan: Anyway goodnight all - tmr we aim for copper 2
[07/07/2025, 00:46:55] Dakota: Take a ram, and get over site and the game should be yours except for the singular roamed
[07/07/2025, 00:47:10] Stan: Frrr
[07/07/2025, 00:47:26] Stan: If you have any other intel operator like iq or lion it gets even easier
[07/07/2025, 00:47:38] Stan: You can force the other team to move when they don’t want to
[07/07/2025, 00:48:02] Dakota: Who’s better for intel, lion or dok?
[07/07/2025, 00:48:19] Stan: Hmm
[07/07/2025, 00:48:23] Stan: It’s gotta be dok
[07/07/2025, 00:48:37] Stan: But if you have iq she can see the others when they try and hang up
[07/07/2025, 00:48:41] Stan: Easy wall bang potential
[07/07/2025, 00:49:11] Dakota: Alright who for pings, cav or jackal?
[07/07/2025, 00:49:23] Stan: Cav is better for team play
[07/07/2025, 00:49:37] Stan: Jackal can get roamers pretty easy
[07/07/2025, 00:49:48] Stan: What about thermite or ace?
[07/07/2025, 00:49:57] Stan: Who breaches better?
[07/07/2025, 00:50:46] Dakota: I say ace, bc you can shoot the second canister to make it head hole only, instead of getting jumped out on
[07/07/2025, 00:51:14] Stan: Fairs
[07/07/2025, 00:51:33] Stan: Imma eep mow
[07/07/2025, 00:51:35] Stan: Now
[07/07/2025, 00:51:46] Stan: Gotta get ready for tmrs games
[07/07/2025, 00:52:49] Dakota: Stay up, why rest when the games still on
[07/07/2025, 00:52:57] Stan: Shhh
[07/07/2025, 00:53:05] Stan: I’m making good decisions for once
[07/07/2025, 00:53:56] Dakota: Nah that’s what adulthood is for
[07/07/2025, 00:54:32] Stan: I’m gonna sleep for like ~5 hours
[07/07/2025, 00:54:36] Stan: Then right back to it
[07/07/2025, 00:55:02] Dakota: Or
[07/07/2025, 00:55:09] Dakota: Go for 5 hours, then sleep
[07/07/2025, 00:55:16] Stan: Shhhh

[07/07/2025, 00:56:26] Stan: I’m not getting my laptop to play siege 😭
[07/07/2025, 00:57:22] Dakota: Ha loser imagine not having console in your room
[07/07/2025, 00:57:34] Stan: I did

[07/07/2025, 14:47:42] Dakota: Turned out to be an episode of American horror stories

[12/07/2025, 18:31:46] ceylan: not the same one?
[12/07/2025, 18:32:00] William Stothard: Uhhh no
[12/07/2025, 18:32:03] William Stothard: I think
[12/07/2025, 18:32:05] ceylan: dang it
[12/07/2025, 18:32:35] ceylan: i want to do a dragon born
[12/07/2025, 18:32:42] ceylan: what would make sense for their class to be?
[12/07/2025, 18:32:48] ceylan: like i don’t want to make something silly u get me
[12/07/2025, 18:33:25] William Stothard: Uhh anything really, but I'd avoid quote unquote, typically unintelligent classes
[12/07/2025, 18:33:34] William Stothard: Like barbarian,
[12/07/2025, 18:33:36] ceylan: right okay
[12/07/2025, 18:33:40] ceylan: so they’re smart?
[12/07/2025, 18:33:58] William Stothard: @⁨Stan⁩ / @⁨Jack Payne⁩  take over for me wouldya
[12/07/2025, 18:35:27] Dakota: Id recommend something with nature, so Druid or ranger, or possibly a religious type, so mainly paladin
[12/07/2025, 18:35:28] Jack Payne: So it really depends on what type of Dragonborn you go for 
Because some classes benefit more from the resistance you get
[12/07/2025, 18:35:49] ceylan: okay i feel in my soul i may have to research this more
[12/07/2025, 18:36:02] ceylan: i’ll figure my shit out perhaps tomorrow i was just brainstorming
[12/07/2025, 18:36:09] Dakota: Bane of your existence
[12/07/2025, 18:36:14] ceylan: fr
[12/07/2025, 18:36:32] Jack Payne: I’m assuming your using 2014 rules Dragonborn since they’re arguably better
[12/07/2025, 18:36:51] ceylan: yur
[12/07/2025, 18:37:29] Jack Payne: Also I have no idea what will was going on about with avoiding the less intelligent classes 
They get a 2 star boost to strength and a plus to charisma
[12/07/2025, 18:37:43] Jack Payne: Gem Dragonborn make unhinged barbarians
[12/07/2025, 18:37:48] William Stothard: Welp fuck me then
[12/07/2025, 18:37:59] ceylan: what classes benefit from  charisma?
[12/07/2025, 18:38:03] ceylan: and aren’t
[12/07/2025, 18:38:04] ceylan: street
[12/07/2025, 18:38:04] Dakota: The breath weapon really lends itself to a melee type person
[12/07/2025, 18:38:06] ceylan: strength
[12/07/2025, 18:38:25] William Stothard: Sorcerer, rogue to a point, and warlock
[12/07/2025, 18:38:30] Jack Payne: Warlock 
Sorceror
Bard
Cleric (I think)
All charisma casters
[12/07/2025, 18:38:34] ceylan: thank you
[12/07/2025, 18:38:36] Dakota: Warlock and bard are the major charismas
[12/07/2025, 18:38:39] William Stothard: Cleric is wisdom
[12/07/2025, 18:39:22] Dakota: Guys who wants to hop on?
[12/07/2025, 18:39:30] William Stothard: What the big ow
[12/07/2025, 18:39:45] ceylan: out of the charisma classes who’s the easiest to understand basiclalt
[12/07/2025, 18:40:06] William Stothard: Probs warlock?
[12/07/2025, 18:40:16] William Stothard: Imo
[12/07/2025, 18:40:16] Dakota: Bard, but warlock is almost as easy if you can handle the spells
[12/07/2025, 18:40:37] ceylan: alrighty
[12/07/2025, 18:40:40] Jack Payne: Emerald dragon born bear totem barbarian
Would recommend
[12/07/2025, 18:40:52] William Stothard: That would be 2 barbarian tho
[12/07/2025, 18:40:53] ceylan: no idea what this means but i’ll have a look tomorrow
[12/07/2025, 18:40:59] Jack Payne: Fair
[12/07/2025, 18:41:02] William Stothard: Basically
[12/07/2025, 18:41:08] William Stothard: Read the dragon colour table
[12/07/2025, 18:41:13] William Stothard: And pick a cool one
[12/07/2025, 18:41:16] William Stothard: Go from there
[12/07/2025, 18:41:19] ceylan: yar
[12/07/2025, 18:41:29] William Stothard: Decide class after colour
[12/07/2025, 18:41:31] William Stothard: Not before
[12/07/2025, 18:41:33] ceylan: okok
[12/07/2025, 18:41:48] Jack Payne: Look at it 
Both the gem Dragonborn subspecies
And the totem barbarian subclass 
Bear variant
[12/07/2025, 18:42:03] William Stothard: We won't have subclasses so dw
[12/07/2025, 18:42:07] William Stothard: We only second level
[12/07/2025, 18:42:17] ceylan: i’d probs pick silver or white tbf
[12/07/2025, 18:42:24] William Stothard: Cool

[12/07/2025, 18:43:43] Dakota: Anyway, hopping on… who’s up
[12/07/2025, 18:44:01] Stan: I’m always up but will said he ain’t feeling it
[12/07/2025, 18:44:10] William Stothard: For white dragons, I'd recommend doing ranger actually
[12/07/2025, 18:44:19] William Stothard: Or unironically barbarian
[12/07/2025, 18:44:25] ceylan: is that like how n arrow type shit
[12/07/2025, 18:44:30] Stan: Bow
[12/07/2025, 18:44:30] William Stothard: Just from how white dragons are described
[12/07/2025, 18:44:33] ceylan: robin hood type shit
[12/07/2025, 18:44:35] ceylan: okok
[12/07/2025, 18:44:37] William Stothard: Kinda
[12/07/2025, 18:44:42] William Stothard: More just lethal hunters
[12/07/2025, 18:44:47] Stan: Also statistically the worst class
[12/07/2025, 18:44:56] William Stothard: But its 2nd level so dw
[12/07/2025, 18:44:58] Stan: But it mostly focuses on survival and tracking
[12/07/2025, 18:44:58] ceylan: what makes you think i care abt meta cmon..
[12/07/2025, 18:45:22] Stan: If you’re into knowing your environment that’s the class
[12/07/2025, 18:45:38] ceylan: alrigjty
[12/07/2025, 18:45:40] ceylan: thanks
[12/07/2025, 18:45:53] William Stothard: If your doing silver I'd recommend cleric
[12/07/2025, 18:46:07] William Stothard: Just cuz there apparently sociable and good willed
[12/07/2025, 18:46:12] William Stothard: Just a suggestion

[15/07/2025, 19:41:10] ceylan: was so tempted to fork out the 22 quid
[15/07/2025, 20:04:08] ceylan: what specifically within the eberron book would you like us to read
[15/07/2025, 20:04:10] ceylan: cos there’s a lot
[15/07/2025, 20:04:47] Jack Payne: Btw @⁨Stan⁩ 
What backgrounds are we allowing 
Same again with just Eberron and  core 3 books
[15/07/2025, 20:17:13] Stan: Eberron sources and the phb
[15/07/2025, 20:17:26] ceylan: what’s pub
[15/07/2025, 20:17:28] ceylan: phb
[15/07/2025, 20:17:40] Stan: Players handbook
[15/07/2025, 20:17:47] ceylan: okok
[15/07/2025, 20:17:50] Stan: Dms guide too
[15/07/2025, 20:19:05] Jack Payne: Core 3 means PHB DMG and MM
[15/07/2025, 20:19:33] ceylan: wait it’s occuring to me maybe this wasn’t a response to me
[15/07/2025, 20:19:38] ceylan: it is definitely not
[15/07/2025, 20:19:48] ceylan: help!
[15/07/2025, 20:20:30] Jack Payne: Just read all of it
[15/07/2025, 20:20:40] ceylan: shi🫩
[15/07/2025, 20:21:07] Stan: Just the character creation but
[15/07/2025, 20:21:09] Stan: Bit
[15/07/2025, 20:21:13] Stan: The base story
[15/07/2025, 20:21:18] Jack Payne: Though focus on info relating to Sharn probably
[15/07/2025, 20:21:23] Stan: And maybe a lil bit on sharn
[15/07/2025, 20:21:38] Jack Payne: If you character would know more info on sharn definitely
[15/07/2025, 20:21:57] Dakota: Who’s hopping on

[15/07/2025, 20:25:37] Stan: No
[15/07/2025, 20:25:53] Stan: Refer to the class and race list that is pinned
[15/07/2025, 20:26:32] Stan: While firearms exist in eberron they are not very advanced and were not considered as thoroughly as weapons of war
[15/07/2025, 20:26:52] Stan: The civil war prefered projectile wands from the likes of artificers
[15/07/2025, 20:27:29] Stan: There will be powder and ball firearms but they are simple and “outdated” by modern standards
[15/07/2025, 20:34:26] Stan: Any other questions
[15/07/2025, 20:53:40] ceylan: sadly i cannot build my character tonight because signal does not allow for the character builder to open
[15/07/2025, 21:03:59] Jack Payne: Same
I’m gonna try anyway but still
[15/07/2025, 21:18:08] ceylan: ts may sound silly but how am i doing ability scores if ive got no dice with me

[15/07/2025, 21:18:45] ceylan: ah right
[15/07/2025, 21:19:38] ceylan: hey guys is it a crime to use the point buy

[15/07/2025, 22:10:34] William Stothard: Yo can anyone forward the link to Leo's campaign

[17/07/2025, 10:08:08] Leo: It’s easier if he can do it himself
[17/07/2025, 10:08:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: DMs exist
[17/07/2025, 10:08:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s not that deep
[17/07/2025, 10:09:01] Leo: I’m offering a easier method of him doing something
[17/07/2025, 10:09:20] Leo: That doesn’t make him tell you things
[17/07/2025, 10:12:02] Leo: Actually I may do it when I’m there
[17/07/2025, 10:12:51] Leo: So @⁨Stan⁩ only has to  use one computer for notes and dnd beyond shit
[17/07/2025, 12:30:27] Stan: Chat
[17/07/2025, 12:30:49] William Stothard: tahC
[17/07/2025, 12:30:49] Stan: Frankly there are gonna be very few moments in session 1 where an item just appears in your inventory
[17/07/2025, 12:31:00] Stan: I’ll just tell you what you need
[17/07/2025, 12:31:09] Stan: Plus then you’ll actually remember you have it
[17/07/2025, 12:41:24] Dakota: Think how often Ben gives us items compared to how often we actually get items. It’s not often enough to warrant that level of micromanagement
[17/07/2025, 12:42:04] Stan: See Dakota gets it
[17/07/2025, 12:42:09] Stan: He gets good boy points
[17/07/2025, 13:56:05] Stan: @⁨Leo⁩ am i correct in assuming that the level 5 air genasi is your character for my campaign or are they separate?
[17/07/2025, 14:18:16] Leo: My character for your campaign
[17/07/2025, 14:20:43] Leo: Ngl I think everyone should do a thing with your characters on my campaign just do (persons campaign) or (test) at the end of your character name
[17/07/2025, 14:25:33] Stan: The only problem is that genasi don’t exist on the planet of eberron
[17/07/2025, 14:26:11] Stan: This is once again a recommendation for the whole group to examine the character creation section of the source book
[17/07/2025, 15:45:55] Leo: Hey @⁨Stan⁩ what items are allowed
[17/07/2025, 15:46:17] William Stothard: Im assuming no magic ones
[17/07/2025, 15:46:32] Stan: No magic items
[17/07/2025, 15:46:40] Stan: Equipment items within reason
[17/07/2025, 15:46:50] Stan: You are lightly experienced
[17/07/2025, 15:47:28] Dakota: I had a question about artificer in eberron, it looks like there’s the three subclasses but no armourer?
[17/07/2025, 15:47:46] Stan: Yes
[17/07/2025, 15:47:50] William Stothard: Omg are we gonna have 3 artificers
[17/07/2025, 15:48:00] Stan: But the next eberron source includes armorer
[17/07/2025, 15:48:05] Stan: So im allowing armorer
[17/07/2025, 15:48:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: Also are humans allowed? They aren’t specified on the image you sent
[17/07/2025, 15:48:21] Stan: Also im also only allowing 2 of each class
[17/07/2025, 15:48:22] William Stothard: Stan forgot them
[17/07/2025, 15:48:24] William Stothard: But yes
[17/07/2025, 15:48:27] Stan: Yeah i forgor

[17/07/2025, 15:48:53] William Stothard: Snooz u lose
[17/07/2025, 15:49:10] Stan: If you are confused on allowed races check the “races of eberron” section of the book
[17/07/2025, 15:49:33] William Stothard: Dwarves are allowed yeah?
[17/07/2025, 15:49:40] Stan: Yes

[17/07/2025, 15:53:24] Dakota: Very probably, and we don’t have enough levels to bother multiclassing
[17/07/2025, 15:53:31] William Stothard: Oml

[17/07/2025, 15:55:40] Stan: Its what subclasses are for
[17/07/2025, 15:55:53] Stan: A jack of all trades is a master of none
[17/07/2025, 15:56:16] William Stothard: "But often better than a master of one" does not apply here btw
[17/07/2025, 15:56:57] Dakota: Alright alright I’ll try being a single for once

[17/07/2025, 22:33:05] Stan: Tucking into some tagliatelle is gorgeous
[17/07/2025, 22:33:07] ceylan: i would chose most foods over pasta

[18/07/2025, 00:39:13] William Stothard: Ok?
[18/07/2025, 00:39:26] Dakota: Oh I think I may like where this is going
[18/07/2025, 00:39:30] Stan: I may have, against better judgment
[18/07/2025, 00:39:39] Stan: Become a volunteer police cadet

[18/07/2025, 00:41:13] Stan: And ik this may come as a shock
[18/07/2025, 00:41:23] William Stothard: BAT FASTARD
[18/07/2025, 00:41:31] Dakota: Me, Jack, and many more are there. What makes you think we’re straight enough to be squares
[18/07/2025, 00:44:10] Stan: Expect to see me at public events
[18/07/2025, 00:57:52] Dakota: Honestly, I’m glad someone reputable will be known at the police cadets
[18/07/2025, 00:58:10] Stan: I’ll whip em into shape
[18/07/2025, 00:58:22] Stan: Make them something to be proud of
[18/07/2025, 00:58:30] Stan: Okay maybe not that far
[18/07/2025, 00:58:48] Dakota: That’s a lot of shape to whip, and knowing her she’ll probably like it
[18/07/2025, 00:59:12] Stan: There are so many things wrong and right about that sentence
[18/07/2025, 00:59:38] Dakota: Thankfully she’s not there anymore
[18/07/2025, 00:59:43] Dakota: I think
[18/07/2025, 01:00:02] Dakota: Nah she’s been seen in London for a while now
[18/07/2025, 01:25:08] Stan: Sleep tight pookies 💋
[18/07/2025, 01:25:45] Dakota: Just what I’d expect from a police cadet
[18/07/2025, 01:25:53] Stan: Shh
[18/07/2025, 01:26:05] Stan: I’m just in it for the dress uniform
[18/07/2025, 01:26:22] Stan: I finally get to iron sleeves and crease trousers
[18/07/2025, 01:26:26] Stan: Hallelujah
[18/07/2025, 01:26:39] Dakota: Again, much better in the air
[18/07/2025, 01:26:59] Dakota: We have two sets of sleeves to iron, and a set that you don’t
[18/07/2025, 01:27:16] Dakota: Oh wait we have a session tomorrow
[18/07/2025, 01:27:21] Dakota: Damn we should really sleep
[18/07/2025, 01:27:23] Stan: Yeah but then i’d have to be one of you petrol pidgeons
[18/07/2025, 01:27:42] Stan: Well technically yes but also no
[18/07/2025, 01:27:55] Dakota: Better than a plastic nee naur

[18/07/2025, 01:28:25] Stan: Atleast im not navy tho
[18/07/2025, 01:28:32] Stan: It can always get worse
[18/07/2025, 01:28:45] Dakota: So join ambulance cadets?
[18/07/2025, 01:28:54] Stan: Yeah thats what im doing
[18/07/2025, 01:28:57] Stan: I’m doin em both
[18/07/2025, 01:29:07] Stan: Unfortunately thats what she said
[18/07/2025, 01:29:14] Stan: I DID EVERYTHING FOR HER
[18/07/2025, 01:29:33] Dakota: I can’t decide if that makes you better or worse
[18/07/2025, 01:29:59] Stan: Its just something to do to get me experience for university
[18/07/2025, 01:30:11] Stan: And a chance to try something new
[18/07/2025, 01:30:24] Stan: But atleast im not you guys
[18/07/2025, 01:30:39] Stan: If i also joined you i’d have cadets 4 straight nights a week
[18/07/2025, 01:30:57] Dakota: I see no problem with that
[18/07/2025, 01:31:22] Stan: Unfortunately a man can only stand at ease for so many hours before his spine is powder
[18/07/2025, 01:32:22] Dakota: Your ex army and fresh police, there’s not much spine to begin with
[18/07/2025, 01:32:32] Stan: Fair
[18/07/2025, 01:32:44] Dakota: At least you can steal one from the ambulance
[18/07/2025, 01:32:58] Stan: Atleast i don’t have to worry about my shirt forming a right angle any more
[18/07/2025, 01:33:07] Stan: Damn pcs pattern combat shirt
[18/07/2025, 01:33:22] Dakota: Ha

[18/07/2025, 01:34:10] Dakota: We’re a mix of dpm or mtp
[18/07/2025, 01:34:18] Stan: The mtp ones are pcs
[18/07/2025, 01:34:21] Dakota: Depending what stock they can get

[18/07/2025, 01:35:26] Stan: Wdym by that
[18/07/2025, 01:35:42] Stan: Atleadt we don’t call them BDUs or some such nonsense
[18/07/2025, 01:35:48] Stan: Acronyms fuel the army
[18/07/2025, 01:35:58] Stan: PCS
[18/07/2025, 01:36:01] Stan: PLCE
[18/07/2025, 01:36:07] Stan: AN/PRC
[18/07/2025, 01:36:08] Dakota: They do, but at least pick good acronyms
[18/07/2025, 01:36:10] Stan: PRR
[18/07/2025, 01:36:18] Stan: FUBAR
[18/07/2025, 01:36:43] Stan: All of those are real acronyms and have actual meanings
[18/07/2025, 01:36:45] Stan: I swear
[18/07/2025, 01:36:56] Dakota: I believe you
[18/07/2025, 01:37:08] Dakota: Your autism woudknt allow you to lie about that
[18/07/2025, 01:37:26] Stan: But which is the odd one out????
[18/07/2025, 01:37:37] Dakota: FUBAR
[18/07/2025, 01:37:43] Stan: Nope
[18/07/2025, 01:37:55] Stan: One is a designation
[18/07/2025, 01:38:03] Stan: The other 4 are equipment
[18/07/2025, 01:38:49] Dakota: FUBAR is the only one I know, and it is not a specific piece of equipment
[18/07/2025, 01:39:15] Stan: An army trooper has no better piece of equipment at his disposal than swearing at his squaddies
[18/07/2025, 01:39:25] Stan: Its AN/PRC
[18/07/2025, 01:39:43] Stan: It means Army Navy Personal Radio Communications
[18/07/2025, 01:39:48] Stan: Autism over

love island is a a really damaging programme that demeans love and places great emphasis on physical appearance attraction and sex within a relationship and desensitises young people to shit and gives young people a false impression of what natural human bodies should look like and it’s literally just a show based on glorifying ‘drama’ and casual cruelty and promiscuity which is overall just ver damaging on young people going on to form relationships with themself and other people

[28/07/2025, 14:19:47] William Stothard: There is no way for humans to detect moisture, or any degree of "wetness"
[28/07/2025, 14:20:06] Stan: Will just stop being a jackass for once
[28/07/2025, 14:20:39] William Stothard: Im being a smartass not a jackass
[28/07/2025, 14:20:48] William Stothard: I am doing nothing to insult you

[28/07/2025, 14:21:25] ceylan: the feeling
[28/07/2025, 14:21:30] William Stothard: What does it feel like tho?
[28/07/2025, 14:21:38] William Stothard: Cold yes?
[28/07/2025, 14:21:42] ceylan: put ur hand in some water and tell me bro
[28/07/2025, 14:21:44] ceylan: no
[28/07/2025, 14:21:45] ceylan: hot water
[28/07/2025, 14:22:06] ceylan: only doing a little strip
[28/07/2025, 14:22:09] William Stothard: But neither cold water or hot water feels the same
[28/07/2025, 14:22:12] Stan: The permeation of liquid particles through the top layers of skin?
[28/07/2025, 14:22:18] William Stothard: There is no unifying trait between the 2
[28/07/2025, 14:22:29] William Stothard: They do not permeate
[28/07/2025, 14:22:47] ceylan: surely there’s gotta be an osmos explanation somewhere here
[28/07/2025, 14:22:55] William Stothard: That would defeat thr point of skin
[28/07/2025, 14:22:56] ceylan: osmosis
[28/07/2025, 14:23:13] William Stothard: We do not undergo osmosis on our dkin
[28/07/2025, 14:23:16] William Stothard: Skin*
[28/07/2025, 14:23:19] ceylan: under
[28/07/2025, 14:23:24] ceylan: in our body n shit
[28/07/2025, 14:23:32] William Stothard: Oh yes certainly
[28/07/2025, 14:23:41] William Stothard: But we do not feel that do we?
[28/07/2025, 14:23:55] ceylan: bros a hater
[28/07/2025, 14:24:03] Stan: Also will, skin permeation is a thing
[28/07/2025, 14:24:04] William Stothard: Nay
[28/07/2025, 14:24:14] Stan: It is how needleless injections function
[28/07/2025, 14:24:15] William Stothard: Go on
[28/07/2025, 14:24:27] Stan: As to allow intravenous injection
[28/07/2025, 14:24:41] William Stothard: Ok so read the word you just said
[28/07/2025, 14:24:44] William Stothard: Intravenous
[28/07/2025, 14:24:47] William Stothard: Intra meaning in
[28/07/2025, 14:24:56] William Stothard: Venous meaning vein
[28/07/2025, 14:25:01] Stan: Indeed
[28/07/2025, 14:25:05] ceylan: ngl like
[28/07/2025, 14:25:07] ceylan: patches andahit

[28/07/2025, 14:25:12] ceylan: nicotine patches
[28/07/2025, 14:25:15] ceylan: permeates into the skin
[28/07/2025, 14:25:15] William Stothard: The shit is still in your veins despite being needless
[28/07/2025, 14:25:32] Stan: And how does it get there?
[28/07/2025, 14:26:12] William Stothard: Through electricity typically
[28/07/2025, 14:26:22] William Stothard: Used to charge the particles of said drug
[28/07/2025, 14:26:29] William Stothard: Allowing it to permeate your skin
[28/07/2025, 14:26:39] William Stothard: But it requires an outside force to do so
[28/07/2025, 14:26:51] William Stothard: Unlike osmosis or simple diffusion
[28/07/2025, 14:26:58] William Stothard: Of which our skin does not allow
[28/07/2025, 14:27:14] William Stothard: As to protect us from common waterborne pathogens
[28/07/2025, 14:27:31] ceylan: biology alevel ahhh 6 mark answer

[28/07/2025, 14:28:20] William Stothard: Bro gonna nuh uh me fr
[28/07/2025, 14:28:21] Stan: the later of skin which is waterproof is the stratum corneum
[28/07/2025, 14:28:28] Stan: Which isn’t the top layer
[28/07/2025, 14:28:40] Stan: My original statement only mentions the top layers
[28/07/2025, 14:28:55] Stan: Holup nvm
[28/07/2025, 14:28:57] William Stothard: Stan the top layer is like 1 ųm thick

[28/07/2025, 14:29:12] Stan: My statement is still correct
[28/07/2025, 14:29:18] William Stothard: Hmm?
[28/07/2025, 14:29:36] Stan: Additionally can’t the water enter through the sweat pores
[28/07/2025, 14:29:41] William Stothard: No?
[28/07/2025, 14:29:56] William Stothard: That would also invalidate the point of sweat
[28/07/2025, 14:30:20] Stan: And more importantly this argument is a stupid roundabout way of you being a smartass cus i called you captain obvious
[28/07/2025, 14:30:30] William Stothard: Indeed

[02/09/2025, 21:48:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: IS A FUCKING MACHETE
[02/09/2025, 21:48:51] Stan: YEEESSSSSS
[02/09/2025, 21:49:20] Dakota: Oh that’s super store? Damn
[02/09/2025, 21:49:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: Imma need an extra 500 super credits this time
[02/09/2025, 21:49:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz the light armour is super store
[02/09/2025, 21:50:38] Dakota: What’s the passive?
[02/09/2025, 23:32:21] Oscar Hunt Brown: Chat
[02/09/2025, 23:32:33] Oscar Hunt Brown: We’re going worm hunting tomorrow
[02/09/2025, 23:32:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: And it’s gonna be hard
[02/09/2025, 23:32:49] River: What
[02/09/2025, 23:32:55] Dakota: I’ve seen clips, apparently there’s a new vehicle?
[02/09/2025, 23:32:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: Hive lords
[02/09/2025, 23:33:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: 150k hp
[02/09/2025, 23:33:27] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m pretty sure the same armour as a leviathan
[02/09/2025, 23:33:41] Oscar Hunt Brown: Meaning only anti tank weapons can scratch it
[02/09/2025, 23:33:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: And for reference
[02/09/2025, 23:33:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: A hellbomb does 10k damage
[02/09/2025, 23:34:17] Dakota: Shit
[02/09/2025, 23:34:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: Compared to a bile titan we’re basically trying to kill god
[02/09/2025, 23:35:01] Dakota: How much damage does landing on something do?
[02/09/2025, 23:35:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: Not as much as a hellbomb
[02/09/2025, 23:35:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: And hive lords are *huge*
[02/09/2025, 23:35:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: Like
[02/09/2025, 23:35:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: Bigger than the skeletons we’ve seen
[02/09/2025, 23:36:06] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I don’t know what difficulty they spawn on
[02/09/2025, 23:36:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: I would assume only 7-10
[02/09/2025, 23:36:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: But it might only be 9 and 10
[02/09/2025, 23:36:23] Dakota: I imagine they’ll be the entire objective
[02/09/2025, 23:36:33] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t think they are
[02/09/2025, 23:36:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: With that level of health
[02/09/2025, 23:37:03] Oscar Hunt Brown: You can’t just go and kill one
[02/09/2025, 23:37:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: You have to kit yourself out to slay a hive lord
[02/09/2025, 23:37:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: Remember that every enemy in the game can be one shot by a hellbomb
[02/09/2025, 23:38:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: The hive lord needs an equivalent of 15 to kill it
[02/09/2025, 23:38:19] Dakota: That’s tomorrows problems for tomorrows divers, for now we need to sleep
[02/09/2025, 23:38:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: The orbital laser does 600 dps
[02/09/2025, 23:39:27] Oscar Hunt Brown: So 18,000 damage total
[02/09/2025, 23:39:58] Dakota: Ok that’s not too bad
[02/09/2025, 23:40:14] Dakota: Also who was going to tell me there’s weapon customisation?

[12/09/2025, 12:42:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: I had personal development
[12/09/2025, 12:42:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I have no issues with the lesson
[12/09/2025, 12:42:55] Oscar Hunt Brown: But the teacher
[12/09/2025, 12:42:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: Holy shit
[12/09/2025, 12:43:11] Dakota: Who was it?
[12/09/2025, 12:43:11] River: What are they like
[12/09/2025, 12:43:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: She makes me actively want to leap out of a window
[12/09/2025, 12:43:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: Miss Watkins
[12/09/2025, 12:43:28] Oscar Hunt Brown: A walking contradiction
[12/09/2025, 12:43:34] River: Is she old
[12/09/2025, 12:43:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: No
[12/09/2025, 12:43:46] River: Ah
[12/09/2025, 12:44:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: But she wants control over a classroom
[12/09/2025, 12:44:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: While the rules she states only work when people respect each other
[12/09/2025, 12:44:21] James: Welcome to my world with me person
[12/09/2025, 12:44:24] James: *leeson
[12/09/2025, 12:44:28] River: She's insecure based off the fact the classroom is the only thing she has control over dam
[12/09/2025, 12:44:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yes but also no
[12/09/2025, 12:45:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: The main issue I have is that one of the “rules” is “we do not judge or assume things about people”
[12/09/2025, 12:45:25] James: So don’t be racist
[12/09/2025, 12:45:28] River: Fr
[12/09/2025, 12:45:40] River: Be a good person
[12/09/2025, 12:45:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: But her whole teaching style is based off the assumption that people are willing to discuss the topic at hand and share thoughts
[12/09/2025, 12:45:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: Which I want to do neither
[12/09/2025, 12:46:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: I find her insufferable to the point that I refuse to tell her my full name or form
[12/09/2025, 12:46:36] River: Real
[12/09/2025, 12:46:47] James: What’d you say when she asked

[12/09/2025, 12:47:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: Just gave her my first name

[12/09/2025, 12:56:18] River: My brothers mate who offed himself years ago

[14/09/2025, 16:49:42] ceylan: take time for yourself and slow shit down and talk to the people around u king fr
[14/09/2025, 16:49:53] River: What ceylan said fr
[14/09/2025, 16:50:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s more of a lack of motivation to do anything
[14/09/2025, 16:50:19] River: I hope things start to even out soon tho
[14/09/2025, 16:50:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: I do too

[14/09/2025, 16:50:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: That I can do
[14/09/2025, 16:50:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: That I’ll think about doing
[14/09/2025, 16:50:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: And then not do
[14/09/2025, 16:51:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ve got some maths homework that I need to do
[14/09/2025, 16:51:21] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I can’t bring myself to even find it
[14/09/2025, 16:51:27] Oscar Hunt Brown: I know it won’t take long
[14/09/2025, 16:51:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I know it won’t be super challenging
[14/09/2025, 16:51:48] River: I can't tell you how much i relate to that
[14/09/2025, 16:51:58] River: And understand what you're going thru
[14/09/2025, 16:52:02] River: Its a shitty time
[14/09/2025, 16:52:18] Stan: Chin up king, shit gets shitty but you can pull through
[14/09/2025, 16:52:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: I just don’t know what to do about this
[14/09/2025, 16:52:56] Stan: As always though i gotta do the responsible thing and recommend seeking help from a loved one or professional
[14/09/2025, 16:53:12] River: Icl writing helped me
[14/09/2025, 16:53:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: I would much rather discuss it with you guys than anyone else ‎<This message was edited>
[14/09/2025, 16:53:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: And
[14/09/2025, 16:53:36] Stan: If you want a private conversation without your parents i’d recommend checking the ashby welfare line
[14/09/2025, 16:53:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ve had a major question on my mind
[14/09/2025, 16:53:45] River: Just write about anything and everything, might be boring at the start but then it helps to get you up to do literally anything
[14/09/2025, 16:53:49] River: Ask
[14/09/2025, 16:53:49] ceylan: ya?
[14/09/2025, 16:53:49] Stan: Shoot
[14/09/2025, 16:53:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: So
[14/09/2025, 16:53:59] ceylan: ts helps so good when shits a lot fr
[14/09/2025, 16:54:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ve got two routes I can go down at the moment
[14/09/2025, 16:54:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: One of them is do a shitload at a level then go to uni
[14/09/2025, 16:54:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: The other is do less at a level, and teach myself language models
[14/09/2025, 16:55:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: One gives me money, the other gives me flexibility
[14/09/2025, 16:55:15] ceylan: honestly do what you think you can achieve with a good mental wellbeing rather than what you can achieve whilst pushing yourself
[14/09/2025, 16:55:27] ceylan: outcome is the lesser factor if wellbeing is the cost ‎<This message was edited>
[14/09/2025, 16:55:29] River: No matter what you do, at some point you'll regret it and want to do the other so just pick the one that makes you feel the best
[14/09/2025, 16:55:30] ceylan: atleast for me anyways
[14/09/2025, 16:55:33] Stan: I would recommend working hard at A level, regardless of whether you go to uni or not, the A levels will be valuable regardless of what you do
[14/09/2025, 16:55:45] Stan: Worry about what comes next after that
[14/09/2025, 16:55:48] Stan: Take a gap year
[14/09/2025, 16:55:50] Stan: Travel
[14/09/2025, 16:55:55] Stan: Learn those models
[14/09/2025, 16:56:10] Stan: But make sure you get atleast useable grades at this point
[14/09/2025, 16:56:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ok
[14/09/2025, 16:56:24] ceylan: discuss with your teachers/tutors in the appropriate subject bc they’ll have good and more tailored advice goo
[14/09/2025, 16:56:33] ceylan: to*
[14/09/2025, 16:56:34] ceylan: too
[14/09/2025, 16:56:35] ceylan: dick
[14/09/2025, 16:56:38] ceylan: fuck
[14/09/2025, 16:56:39] Stan: And ashby has a mental health line ong
[14/09/2025, 16:56:43] ceylan: yes yes
[14/09/2025, 16:56:53] ceylan: also there’s no pressure to decide this this year oscar
[14/09/2025, 16:57:11] ceylan: this year if you just wanna sit in the middle of it all and then next year when you’re exams are you decide
[14/09/2025, 16:57:28] Stan: Don’t gotta make it a case or seek permanent healthcare, just yap at a professional for 25 minutes if thats what you want
[14/09/2025, 16:57:50] River: And if things go wrong then ask for support,  in studies or for mental support
[14/09/2025, 16:58:00] River: Everyone needs some help sometimes
[14/09/2025, 16:58:25] ceylan: definitely a canon event to be having a crises when you get to further ed bc it’s literally up to you now and that’s fine yk and as someone who did the exact same thing last year you do not need to decide what you’re doing rn atleast bc ur doing very widespread use courses too! you have time and you have people dude so just like yk chill and have fun
[14/09/2025, 16:59:10] Stan: You A and T level students are lucky that you can cruise the first year ong
[14/09/2025, 16:59:21] Stan: I have to lock in both years or fail entirely ‎<This message was edited>
[14/09/2025, 16:59:26] ceylan: nah pal we had our exams last year 😭
[14/09/2025, 16:59:29] ceylan: literally me too
[14/09/2025, 16:59:36] Oscar Hunt Brown: I can’t this year, sort of
[14/09/2025, 16:59:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz of further maths
[14/09/2025, 16:59:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I’m already falling behind in physics
[14/09/2025, 17:00:15] River: Is there no way to swap a subject out or smth?
[14/09/2025, 17:00:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: I can
[14/09/2025, 17:00:22] Stan: 1st year- do as well as you can while remaining healthy
2nd year- pick what to prioritise
[14/09/2025, 17:00:27] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I’m heavily considering it
[14/09/2025, 17:00:27] River: Do you _want_ to?
[14/09/2025, 17:00:49] ceylan: a lot of people drop out of further maths and that’s fine bc literally doing maths alone is an achievement and a half anyways
[14/09/2025, 17:00:50] Stan: Do what makes you happy my man
[14/09/2025, 17:00:52] Stan: Simple as
[14/09/2025, 17:00:57] River: Don't do too much at the start and then nothing after fr
[14/09/2025, 17:01:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: Maths is not the issue here tbh
[14/09/2025, 17:01:06] River: Spread it out and do stuff that you can
[14/09/2025, 17:01:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m doing perfectly fine in maths
[14/09/2025, 17:01:10] Stan: We may be overwhelming him a lil guys
[14/09/2025, 17:01:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: No it’s good
[14/09/2025, 17:01:42] River: Talking about classes you're not doing as well as you want to in- is there any support you can get in them?
[14/09/2025, 17:01:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t know
[14/09/2025, 17:02:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: But the core issue at the moment is my lack of motivation
[14/09/2025, 17:02:06] Oscar Hunt Brown: Both as I am now
[14/09/2025, 17:02:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: And in general
[14/09/2025, 17:02:23] River: I'm happy that you're telling us about this
[14/09/2025, 17:02:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: Leo said a similar thing the other day
[14/09/2025, 17:03:15] River: Its better to get it out than to bottle it up
[14/09/2025, 17:03:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[14/09/2025, 17:03:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: The thing is that I’ve put off sorting this out for years now
[14/09/2025, 17:04:14] River: If you ever need a day to just sit in silence with someone we're here for you
[14/09/2025, 17:04:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: And it’s become an actual issue now that I’m doing a lot of academic stuff
[14/09/2025, 17:04:22] Stan: We’re here, professionals are available, don’t worry about it
[14/09/2025, 17:04:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m worrying about it though
[14/09/2025, 17:04:46] Stan: We can help motivate you
[14/09/2025, 17:04:48] River: Its normal to worry yk
[14/09/2025, 17:04:57] River: And we are here thru it all
[14/09/2025, 17:04:57] Stan: But i cannot stress, make that call king
[14/09/2025, 17:05:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t know
[14/09/2025, 17:05:29] River: Talk to them ong
[14/09/2025, 17:05:39] Oscar Hunt Brown: I just feel clueless tbh
[14/09/2025, 17:05:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: I can’t decide
[14/09/2025, 17:06:17] Stan: Do you have a student ID number?
[14/09/2025, 17:06:20] River: Its better to do something than nothing
[14/09/2025, 17:06:28] Oscar Hunt Brown: Not that I know
[14/09/2025, 17:06:34] Stan: Alr
[14/09/2025, 17:06:41] Stan: I’d say give them a call
[14/09/2025, 17:06:49] Stan: It can be as long or short as you want ong
[14/09/2025, 17:06:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: I know, and that’s kinda part of the problem
[14/09/2025, 17:08:35] William Stothard: Yk bro as a fellow a level student, I get it, sometimes its hard to be motivated, I struggle especially when im in my own home, the best thing I cant recommend is to talk to a councillor about it, but also to try and foster some healthy habits, ive been trying recently to foster those habits as well, trying to link free time with revision time, just trying to associate non helpful problems with healthier solutions (free time=revising etc)
[14/09/2025, 17:08:48] William Stothard: Can* not cant
[14/09/2025, 17:09:05] Dakota: You should do, but I don’t think Ashby put it on the cards. Take a look on arbor if they still use it and it should’ve somewhere on there
[14/09/2025, 17:09:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ok
[14/09/2025, 17:09:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: Thanks
[14/09/2025, 17:09:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ll try, hopefully?
[14/09/2025, 17:10:06] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’d be lying if I said it would happen
[14/09/2025, 17:10:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: And thanks for being there for me again guys
[14/09/2025, 17:10:29] William Stothard: Anytime mate, we'll always be here
[14/09/2025, 17:10:39] Dakota: No problem, that’s what I good friend group is for
[14/09/2025, 17:11:39] William Stothard: All you can do, eventually the positive habits will stick and you'll get the hang of it, but honestly I wouldn't stress too much about it getting this whole further education thing right first try
[14/09/2025, 19:01:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: Some better news: I have convinced my parents to stop pausing the ps5 at night
[14/09/2025, 19:01:25] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I also managed to finish my maths homework
[14/09/2025, 19:03:09] River: YAYY

[16/09/2025, 13:38:36] Oscar Hunt Brown: Chat
[16/09/2025, 13:38:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: I had a thunk
[16/09/2025, 13:38:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: And it has become problematic
[16/09/2025, 13:39:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: The processor in my build doesn’t matter too much in 4k
[16/09/2025, 13:39:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: But everywhere else it kinda does
[16/09/2025, 13:39:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: So I looked at am4 alternatives
[16/09/2025, 13:39:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I came across the ryzen 9 5950x
[16/09/2025, 13:39:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: An absolute monster
[16/09/2025, 13:40:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: Twice as many cores, double the cache and higher clock rates
[16/09/2025, 13:40:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: But
[16/09/2025, 13:40:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: It costs twice as much as the ryzen 7 5800x on the low end
[16/09/2025, 13:40:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I really want a nice processor to pair with my sexy graphics card
[16/09/2025, 13:41:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: I shall have to consult my parents regarding the budget
[16/09/2025, 13:41:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz if I want to do this then it’ll add like £120 on
[16/09/2025, 13:41:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I’m already about £80 over
[16/09/2025, 13:42:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: I hoping they don’t remember what I said the budget was
[16/09/2025, 13:42:30] Dakota: Did you give an exact figure or a rough rounded figure?
[16/09/2025, 15:30:03] Jack Payne: Major order for the bot front boys
Let’s gooooo
[16/09/2025, 15:34:19] Dakota: Three planets to clear, and hold Hell

[16/09/2025, 18:55:45] River: Then add a tiddy mask
[16/09/2025, 18:57:36] Dakota: Meditate with the tiddy mask on

[16/09/2025, 18:59:12] River: Grow some
[16/09/2025, 18:59:34] William Stothard: What an amazing idea why didn't I think of that
[16/09/2025, 19:06:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: I initially said £800 (£900 including mouse and keyboard), but the build currently costs around £100 more than that
[16/09/2025, 19:06:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: Also it doesn’t matter now ‎<This message was edited>

[17/09/2025, 15:47:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: For about 5 weeks
[17/09/2025, 15:47:52] Jack Payne: Damn it ‎<This message was edited>
[17/09/2025, 15:55:39] Jack Payne: Speaking of helldivers though
Who wants to play some
[17/09/2025, 17:36:52] Dakota: Damn 175 supers
[17/09/2025, 20:37:31] Dakota: Chat we need to do a collective d of e
[17/09/2025, 20:37:38] Dakota: You can do dnd as the skills section
[17/09/2025, 20:37:39] Stan: Do we?
[17/09/2025, 20:37:51] Stan: Most of is have do e it ong
[17/09/2025, 20:55:24] William Stothard: Yeah ive already done my bronze and i am fine not doing more
[17/09/2025, 22:32:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m doing gold if you want to try and join me Dakota
[17/09/2025, 22:32:27] Oscar Hunt Brown: If you haven’t done silver you’ll need to do some extra time
[17/09/2025, 23:15:24] Dakota: Yeah no I’ve been signed up for bronze with cadets for the last 4 years and still don’t have even a plan so gold is going to be just a little out of my reach
[18/09/2025, 08:29:48] Jack Payne: Guys 
We’ve captured the first planet for the major order
The next planet is about to get 380 HE barrages from the DSS and it seems to be eagle friendly as well ‎<This message was edited>
[18/09/2025, 13:22:46] Dakota: We need to work on liberating Valyria 5 for I think potentially a new type of exosuit, or cheopessa iv for a new orbital bomb
[18/09/2025, 13:44:03] Jack Payne: That’s so tough
[18/09/2025, 13:48:27] Jack Payne: I’ve decided I’d prefer a mech
[18/09/2025, 13:49:13] Jack Payne: After carefully rewatching the recordings of past tapes of missions
Death rates to mechs are lower than to orbitals
[18/09/2025, 13:49:16] Stan: Idk if it’s a new mech/orbital or if it’s just the free stratagem choice
[18/09/2025, 13:49:27] Stan: Because it specifically says emancipator parts
[18/09/2025, 13:49:31] Dakota: It might be a new type, or just upgraded emancipators
[18/09/2025, 13:49:43] Stan: I’m guessing free emancipators
[18/09/2025, 13:49:48] Stan: For a short while
[18/09/2025, 13:49:57] Jack Payne: I recon it’s a new thing 
Since they’re planning big upgrades for the fight against the bugs
[18/09/2025, 13:49:59] Stan: Since if it were something new they would say so outright
[18/09/2025, 13:50:08] Jack Payne: As is the purpose of the currentmajor order
[18/09/2025, 13:50:28] Stan: They have always told us when we were fighting for something new
[18/09/2025, 13:50:35] Stan: Remember AT mines?
[18/09/2025, 13:51:06] Dakota: True
[18/09/2025, 13:51:18] Jack Payne: That is a good point but I’d still prefer a mech to orbitals
[18/09/2025, 13:51:30] Stan: As would i
[18/09/2025, 13:51:51] Dakota: They’ve both been added to the major order and it didn’t say anything about a time limit so I think we are probably allowed both
[18/09/2025, 13:51:55] Jack Payne: Imagine if it does end up being a new mech though
[18/09/2025, 13:52:05] Jack Payne: We may finally be getting the flamer mech
[18/09/2025, 13:52:16] Dakota: Or a laser mech
[18/09/2025, 13:52:17] Stan: I wouldn’t get my hopes up
[18/09/2025, 13:52:42] Jack Payne: Fair
[18/09/2025, 13:53:23] Jack Payne: One can hope though
[18/09/2025, 13:53:27] Stan: Although we also haven’t had a new free stratagem since the wasp
[18/09/2025, 13:53:34] Stan: Which came out in February
[18/09/2025, 13:53:40] Jack Payne: And that was absolutely ass
[18/09/2025, 13:53:49] Jack Payne: It’s better now but it ain’t good
[18/09/2025, 13:54:07] Stan: It was part of the killzone crossover, so their creative liberties aren’t really that much
[18/09/2025, 14:29:03] William Stothard: Labubu shirts spotted in Loughborough
[18/09/2025, 14:29:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: no.

[18/09/2025, 14:57:47] Stan: He hath ordained your purchase
[18/09/2025, 14:58:00] ceylan: probs just 50
[18/09/2025, 14:58:26] Stan: Yk the celestine aura is too much not to take
[18/09/2025, 14:59:31] ceylan: true but ALSO idk what i want to do
[18/09/2025, 14:59:42] William Stothard: Also from a beginner standpoint
[18/09/2025, 14:59:43] ceylan: bc if i pick an army which is hard enough as it is then i have to pick if im gonna do my own computs
[18/09/2025, 14:59:45] ceylan: colours
[18/09/2025, 14:59:49] ceylan: its too  much decision making
[18/09/2025, 15:00:01] William Stothard: Celestine is easier to paint than belakor
[18/09/2025, 15:00:07] William Stothard: Smaller surface area
[18/09/2025, 15:00:10] William Stothard: And less spikes
[18/09/2025, 15:00:19] ceylan: true
[18/09/2025, 15:00:25] Stan: I would seriously advise not starting either army with their flagship model
[18/09/2025, 15:00:34] Stan: Especially if you don’t know how you want to paint them
[18/09/2025, 15:00:40] William Stothard: She'll also be more interesting to paint than belakor
[18/09/2025, 15:00:45] ceylan: hmm
[18/09/2025, 15:00:53] William Stothard: As you'll get from new surface to surface easier
[18/09/2025, 15:00:56] ceylan: im so torn
[18/09/2025, 15:01:09] ceylan: fair
[18/09/2025, 15:01:13] William Stothard: Meaning you wont get bored easily compare to painting a big model like bel'akor
[18/09/2025, 15:01:23] ceylan: ya
[18/09/2025, 15:01:25] ceylan: hmm
[18/09/2025, 15:01:33] ceylan: i need to ponde r
[18/09/2025, 15:01:39] William Stothard: Ponder then
[18/09/2025, 15:01:46] William Stothard: No rush when it comes to warhammer
[18/09/2025, 15:01:59] William Stothard: We all know you'll come back eventually to spend more money
[18/09/2025, 15:02:05] ceylan: yeah true
[18/09/2025, 15:02:45] Stan: I would advise moving up in size as you develop your painting skills
[18/09/2025, 15:03:03] William Stothard: Maybe try one of the purgator warsuits
[18/09/2025, 15:03:04] Stan: Painting whole squads allows you to hone your technique better than one large model
[18/09/2025, 15:03:12] Stan: They are drippy
[18/09/2025, 15:03:27] ceylan: but at same time loke
[18/09/2025, 15:03:30] ceylan: spending big money
[18/09/2025, 15:03:33] ceylan: is anxiety inducing
[18/09/2025, 15:03:38] ceylan: even like £40 quid
[18/09/2025, 15:03:41] ceylan: in one go atleast
[18/09/2025, 15:03:51] Stan: Warhammer is an expensive hobby
[18/09/2025, 15:03:52] ceylan: i’m perfectly fine spending 70 squids on vinted across like 5 items
[18/09/2025, 15:03:55] Stan: No denying that
[18/09/2025, 15:03:59] ceylan: but one item?? jeez
[18/09/2025, 15:04:05] ceylan: me ts week btw
[18/09/2025, 15:04:29] William Stothard: Ooh what you bought?
[18/09/2025, 15:04:34] Stan: But spending your money on a model that would provide you with more opportunities to build skill and enjoy the army aesthetic would be good
[18/09/2025, 15:04:42] ceylan: i shall show
[18/09/2025, 15:05:20] Stan: What is your design ceylan?

[25/09/2025, 20:06:20] ceylan: fire fire
[25/09/2025, 20:09:04] Dakota: Blue is not the contrast
[25/09/2025, 20:09:15] Stan: Yk what i mean
[25/09/2025, 20:09:41] Stan: Complements the black better than my already black jacket

[25/09/2025, 20:14:01] Dakota: Then I will turn up to dnd ready to throw hand
[26/09/2025, 11:34:17] Dakota: Chat new strategic opportunities
[26/09/2025, 11:34:33] Stan: Do go on
[26/09/2025, 11:34:50] Dakota: Liberate varylia for free mechs, or oasis for free warp packs
[26/09/2025, 11:34:58] Stan: Hmm interesting
[26/09/2025, 11:35:07] Dakota: Only one tho
[26/09/2025, 11:42:53] Jack Payne: It’s not a free mech 
It’s a new one 
varylia 5 is the same planet as the last bonus order
[26/09/2025, 11:43:42] Jack Payne: And from what i understand the exosuit is likely to be one from the last game
The one with a tank cannon and a flamethrower
[26/09/2025, 11:46:46] Stan: I don’t think it’s a new mech
[26/09/2025, 11:47:17] Stan: The strategic opportunity specifically says “augment the helldiver arsenal for the liberation of the hive world”
[26/09/2025, 11:47:23] Stan: Makes it sound temporary to me
[26/09/2025, 11:47:44] Dakota: I think we should find ojt
[26/09/2025, 11:47:51] Dakota: To the bots we go!
[26/09/2025, 11:48:16] Jack Payne: But at the same time it says 
‘Grant helldivers additional exosuit’
[26/09/2025, 11:48:29] Jack Payne: So it could be a new one
[26/09/2025, 11:48:35] Jack Payne: It’s so bloody vague
[26/09/2025, 11:48:46] Jack Payne: Unfortunately it’s an annoying planet
[26/09/2025, 11:48:58] Dakota: It also says additional warp packs, and they can’t just make a variant of that
[26/09/2025, 11:49:06] Stan: In *every* new stratagem order, it includes the numerical designation of the stratagem
[26/09/2025, 11:49:09] Stan: The exo-49
[26/09/2025, 11:49:17] Stan: The mt-17s
[26/09/2025, 11:49:18] Stan: Etc
[26/09/2025, 11:49:26] Stan: Nowhere to be seen this time
[26/09/2025, 11:50:23] Jack Payne: Varylia is a plains planet so has the most annoying angry plants
Plus it’s weather effect is heavy rain which reduces visibility
[26/09/2025, 11:51:08] Jack Payne: I can still hope
[26/09/2025, 11:51:43] Dakota: How often do they repeat a planet for new things if it’s just temp free?
[26/09/2025, 11:52:02] Dakota: Bc the only repeat I know of is for the tank mines
[26/09/2025, 11:52:54] Jack Payne: You make a good point
[26/09/2025, 11:53:20] Dakota: Wait are there no other repeats?
[26/09/2025, 11:55:58] River: Chat i just had my first blood test

[30/09/2025, 14:54:43] Jack Payne: Good news everyone 
We managed to liberate the last planet with 5 and a half hours left on the clock
[30/09/2025, 14:55:35] Jack Payne: Though now the dss is unavailable
[30/09/2025, 14:55:35] Dakota: Dss is already there, which means no eagle strikes to worry about or blockades to protect hellmire (again)
[30/09/2025, 14:55:53] Jack Payne: No DSS aid at all
[30/09/2025, 14:56:01] Jack Payne: Not till the upgrades are finished
[30/09/2025, 14:56:51] Dakota: Do we know how long? I imagine the next MO will be to protect the planet
[30/09/2025, 14:57:18] Jack Payne: I give it a couple days to a week
And your probably right
[30/09/2025, 14:57:33] Jack Payne: Or it might be another chance to free varylia 5
[30/09/2025, 14:58:02] Jack Payne: Also possible it’s a collect resources to aid in the upgrading process
[30/09/2025, 14:58:13] Dakota: Too bad we can’t call the dss in to orbital blockade the planet
[30/09/2025, 14:58:25] Dakota: Probably that and hold it
[30/09/2025, 14:59:35] Jack Payne: There’s atleast 2 planets that would need to fall before the squids can get to karlia
[30/09/2025, 15:00:04] Jack Payne: Other great news

[30/09/2025, 15:01:05] Dakota: Yeah that’s only like 5 ish missions
[30/09/2025, 15:01:34] Dakota: Hold up does an autocannon do pretty much the same thing damage as a quasar?
[30/09/2025, 15:02:49] Dakota: Because if so then we could just chuck an autocannon sentry down to act as a portable SAM site against bot drops
[30/09/2025, 15:03:50] Jack Payne: I’m stuck on dif 6 
At most I get 3 supers
[30/09/2025, 15:03:58] Jack Payne: It doesn’t
[30/09/2025, 15:04:06] Jack Payne: Rocket sentry may work though
[30/09/2025, 15:05:05] Dakota: Nice
[30/09/2025, 15:35:55] Jack Payne: Anyone want to join me
[30/09/2025, 15:47:31] Dakota: Can’t, gotta work

[01/10/2025, 08:10:01] William Stothard: Forgot to tell you
[01/10/2025, 08:11:56] William Stothard: Glad to hear
[01/10/2025, 09:20:31] William Stothard: Yk chat, it's so saddening to watch housing being built
[01/10/2025, 09:20:43] River: Fr
[01/10/2025, 09:20:47] William Stothard: Like watching the land be torn up and concreted over
[01/10/2025, 09:21:07] River: Nah because what in the helly do we do after
[01/10/2025, 09:21:20] River: Ive been watching that land everyday for six years
[01/10/2025, 09:21:40] James: Is bro turning into the new greta thunburg
[01/10/2025, 09:21:43] William Stothard: Its the same for here near ellistown
[01/10/2025, 09:21:48] William Stothard: Always was
[01/10/2025, 09:22:16] River: Unbsnsjsbsbsbsbbssbbs
[01/10/2025, 09:22:35] William Stothard: English good
[01/10/2025, 09:22:40] Stan: Beautiful corporate expansion
[01/10/2025, 09:22:44] William Stothard: Kys
[01/10/2025, 09:22:54] River: Took the words out of my mouth ong
[01/10/2025, 09:23:20] William Stothard: This was also perfectly good regeneration land
[01/10/2025, 09:23:31] William Stothard: Amend now its overpriced fucking housing
[01/10/2025, 09:23:45] River: Hmo
[01/10/2025, 09:23:49] River: Mass genocide
[01/10/2025, 09:24:00] River: Less people = less housing
[01/10/2025, 09:24:20] William Stothard: Maybe not
[01/10/2025, 09:24:30] William Stothard: But instead of large overpriced detached housing
[01/10/2025, 09:24:37] Dakota: Cannibalism, also solves hunger
[01/10/2025, 09:24:38] William Stothard: How about a decent flat block?
[01/10/2025, 09:25:01] James: Why does bro make a good point
[01/10/2025, 09:25:03] William Stothard: Instead of either this expansionism and the concrete blocs
[01/10/2025, 09:25:05] William Stothard: He does
[01/10/2025, 09:25:24] Stan: Megabuildings
[01/10/2025, 09:25:34] William Stothard: YES
[01/10/2025, 09:25:38] William Stothard: BUT GOOD ONES
[01/10/2025, 09:25:42] Stan: Statistics speaking a human only needs 20 square feet to be alive
[01/10/2025, 09:25:49] William Stothard: Not the kind in sheffield
[01/10/2025, 09:25:54] Stan: We can half that and get away with it
[01/10/2025, 09:25:55] River: Ill kms
[01/10/2025, 09:26:10] William Stothard: Id be so cozy in 30ft squared
[01/10/2025, 09:26:13] William Stothard: 20*
[01/10/2025, 09:26:24] River: I need to frolick when im bored
[01/10/2025, 09:26:44] William Stothard: Ahh but see megabuildings surrounded by forest regeneration
[01/10/2025, 09:26:48] Stan: Throw in a costa and a turkish barber on the bottom floor and we have a government contract
[01/10/2025, 09:26:48] Dakota: But would a couple get 40ft or just 30 bc they sharing?
[01/10/2025, 09:26:59] Stan: 15
[01/10/2025, 09:27:05] Stan: Give or take
[01/10/2025, 09:27:13] William Stothard: Ser stan is joking
[01/10/2025, 09:27:20] William Stothard: But im deadass
[01/10/2025, 09:27:21] River: I wanna keep my garden
[01/10/2025, 09:27:29] Stan: Nah i’m deadass
[01/10/2025, 09:27:29] Dakota: Balcony
[01/10/2025, 09:27:41] Stan: About the initial idea
[01/10/2025, 09:27:48] William Stothard: Public allotments managed by the megabuilding surrounding it
[01/10/2025, 09:27:49] River: Where tf am I meant to grow potatoes
[01/10/2025, 09:28:00] River: And onions and tomatoes and strawberries and carrots
[01/10/2025, 09:28:03] Stan: Leaving my corpotocracy out of it
[01/10/2025, 09:28:05] William Stothard: Meaning no fuckass unions to gatekeep allotments
[01/10/2025, 09:28:13] River: And broccoli and lettuce
[01/10/2025, 09:28:17] William Stothard: .
[01/10/2025, 09:28:21] William Stothard: This bro
[01/10/2025, 09:28:25] Stan: What else do we put on the roof?
[01/10/2025, 09:28:27] River: Everyone should whimsy out
[01/10/2025, 09:28:32] William Stothard: BANGING
[01/10/2025, 09:28:42] Stan: Insulation and free space
[01/10/2025, 09:28:56] River: Babe we are moving to the woods
[01/10/2025, 09:28:58] William Stothard: But these need to be charity managed
[01/10/2025, 09:29:01] Dakota: Solar panels?
[01/10/2025, 09:29:02] William Stothard: Not gov not private
[01/10/2025, 09:29:09] Stan: No
[01/10/2025, 09:29:10] William Stothard: Ooh tricky
[01/10/2025, 09:29:17] River: It wasn't a question
[01/10/2025, 09:29:21] Stan: No
[01/10/2025, 09:29:31] William Stothard: I might actually design ts
[01/10/2025, 09:29:34] Stan: I must have my cyberpunk dreams
[01/10/2025, 09:29:38] River: I like how you think you have an opinion on it
[01/10/2025, 09:29:39] William Stothard: Ahh see
[01/10/2025, 09:29:42] William Stothard: Solarpunk
[01/10/2025, 09:29:49] William Stothard: Best of both our visions
[01/10/2025, 09:30:31] William Stothard: This will be rhe next generation of affordable counsel housing
[01/10/2025, 09:30:36] Dakota: Perhaps rainwater collected to use for hydroelectric power, and then used as normal water for drinking, watering plants and what ever else
[01/10/2025, 09:30:45] William Stothard: And it wont be shit
[01/10/2025, 09:31:13] William Stothard: You've heard of a gravity battery yes?
[01/10/2025, 09:31:28] William Stothard: Thinking hydroelectric gravity battery
[01/10/2025, 09:31:35] Dakota: Exactly
[01/10/2025, 09:31:55] Dakota: From the roof, turbines on the way down, stored underneath for use
[01/10/2025, 09:32:20] William Stothard: Gravity batteries have to rise
[01/10/2025, 09:32:33] William Stothard: So centre of building imo
[01/10/2025, 09:32:50] Dakota: The water cycle does at least part of the rising for us ‎<This message was edited>
[01/10/2025, 09:33:20] Dakota: Then perhaps pay residents to manually move water do extra energy?
[01/10/2025, 09:33:34] Dakota: Not as a full job, but a side hustle for a couple extra quid ‎<This message was edited>
[01/10/2025, 09:34:12] William Stothard: Hm maybe
[01/10/2025, 09:34:41] William Stothard: I think paying them to manage the building they live in sounds good to me
[01/10/2025, 09:35:05] William Stothard: Cuz the government will own this
[01/10/2025, 09:35:14] William Stothard: I aint selling it to no corp
[01/10/2025, 09:36:01] William Stothard: So the building will need, A. Sustainable power generation for around let's call it 3000 people
[01/10/2025, 09:36:18] William Stothard: Jobs that pay more than staying there
[01/10/2025, 09:36:22] William Stothard: For around 3000 people
[01/10/2025, 09:36:47] William Stothard: And a forest regeneration area surrounding it
[01/10/2025, 09:36:57] William Stothard: With public gardens on the roof
[01/10/2025, 09:37:17] William Stothard: Solar panels on the side?
[01/10/2025, 09:37:24] William Stothard: Not as efficient but still
[01/10/2025, 09:37:31] Dakota: Is it going to be purely a place to live, or perhaps shops or similar on ground floors for extra jobs?
[01/10/2025, 09:37:43] William Stothard: Yes I like that
[01/10/2025, 09:38:02] William Stothard: And proper security
[01/10/2025, 09:38:29] William Stothard: To reduce the chance of organised crime entering
[01/10/2025, 09:38:45] William Stothard: Well also need to account for the most common jobs the average person has
[01/10/2025, 09:39:04] Dakota: Not letting them police themselves?
[01/10/2025, 09:39:11] Dakota: Common law and all thay
[01/10/2025, 09:39:26] William Stothard: I meant physically as well as through residents
[01/10/2025, 09:39:35] Dakota: Ah true
[01/10/2025, 09:40:26] William Stothard: Like proper barriers with perhaps a resident key?
[01/10/2025, 09:40:58] Dakota: On the outermost doors, but a free open common area central to the building
[01/10/2025, 09:41:06] William Stothard: Yes
[01/10/2025, 09:41:07] Dakota: Open to visitors as well as residents
[01/10/2025, 09:41:25] William Stothard: Perhaps we could offer education as well as jobs
[01/10/2025, 09:41:27] William Stothard: For all ages
[01/10/2025, 09:42:04] William Stothard: So those we employ to build it, can perhaps learn new qualifications relative to the building allowing them to intergrade to the building
[01/10/2025, 09:42:21] William Stothard: Free ofc
[01/10/2025, 09:42:26] Dakota: Formal education or life skills?
[01/10/2025, 09:42:35] William Stothard: Maybe a mix of both
[01/10/2025, 09:42:49] William Stothard: Depending on the person
[01/10/2025, 09:43:03] William Stothard: So hold on
[01/10/2025, 09:43:24] William Stothard: 3000×20ft=60000sqft
[01/10/2025, 09:43:34] William Stothard: Thats how much floor space we'd need
[01/10/2025, 09:44:22] Dakota: That’s just the housing space tho, no common areas or anything else not even corridors
[01/10/2025, 09:44:28] William Stothard: Yeah
[01/10/2025, 09:44:52] William Stothard: Ik i was just setting a standard for rooms
[01/10/2025, 09:44:55] William Stothard: So let's say
[01/10/2025, 09:45:07] William Stothard: 6 floors for housing
[01/10/2025, 09:45:38] William Stothard: Bottom floor for retail/common area
[01/10/2025, 09:46:00] William Stothard: Middle floor should be education and something else
[01/10/2025, 09:46:11] William Stothard: Top floor should be recreation
[01/10/2025, 09:46:20] William Stothard: 9 floors
[01/10/2025, 09:47:03] Dakota: Exercise, educational (bettering self) or recreational?
[01/10/2025, 09:47:22] William Stothard: Wdym
[01/10/2025, 09:47:52] Dakota: I’m assuming you’ll want to put a gym somewhere rather than relying on the cardio of all those stairs
[01/10/2025, 09:47:59] William Stothard: Yes
[01/10/2025, 09:48:13] William Stothard: Elevators defo
[01/10/2025, 09:48:20] William Stothard: Space considering as well
[01/10/2025, 09:49:11] Dakota: Powered directly through the gravity battery?
[01/10/2025, 09:49:11] Stan: Gp surgery too
[01/10/2025, 09:49:24] William Stothard: Could do
[01/10/2025, 09:49:58] William Stothard: That house
[01/10/2025, 09:50:10] William Stothard: Has the same floor space as one of these housing floors
[01/10/2025, 09:50:48] Dakota: We haven’t considered yet, underground and the benefits as opposed to going up
[01/10/2025, 09:51:03] William Stothard: I dont want to shove the poor underground
[01/10/2025, 09:51:26] William Stothard: But underground does propose benefits for things like shopping
[01/10/2025, 09:51:33] William Stothard: That can go underground
[01/10/2025, 09:51:48] Dakota: Geothermal heating
[01/10/2025, 09:51:49] William Stothard: Also we are talking 9 floors
[01/10/2025, 09:51:54] William Stothard: Its kpt.that big ngl
[01/10/2025, 09:51:56] Dakota: We can do a mix
[01/10/2025, 09:53:05] William Stothard: No sadly people need sunlight
[01/10/2025, 09:53:25] William Stothard: And i hope to give every room some access to sunlight
[01/10/2025, 09:54:04] Dakota: Rock and stone?
[01/10/2025, 09:54:19] Stan: Basement parking
[01/10/2025, 09:54:44] Stan: Though we’ll try to keep pedestrians safe
[01/10/2025, 09:54:49] Stan: Minimise road usage
[01/10/2025, 09:54:54] William Stothard: Unlikely to have car access
[01/10/2025, 09:55:13] William Stothard: The point of this is that people will not need to leave
[01/10/2025, 09:55:15] Stan: Depends on proximity to other buildings
[01/10/2025, 09:55:22] Stan: But they may want too
[01/10/2025, 09:55:29] Stan: Holidays employment etc
[01/10/2025, 09:55:32] William Stothard: Public transport
[01/10/2025, 09:55:41] William Stothard: Employment is provided by the building
[01/10/2025, 09:55:43] Stan: Basement rail hub then
[01/10/2025, 09:55:50] William Stothard: YES
[01/10/2025, 09:55:55] Dakota: Not for all 3000 surely
[01/10/2025, 09:56:00] Stan: Police officers? Airline pilots? Larger office space?
[01/10/2025, 09:56:09] William Stothard: For at least half of the people
[01/10/2025, 09:56:10] Stan: Assuming people will stay put is a lil foolish
[01/10/2025, 09:56:14] Stan: Humans like to roam
[01/10/2025, 09:56:28] William Stothard: This is a building for those current in unemployment and acclaiment
[01/10/2025, 09:56:48] Stan: It could become the national standard tho
[01/10/2025, 09:57:02] Stan: Can’t forget a parole office then
[01/10/2025, 09:57:09] William Stothard: Ik thats why we are hoping to provide a very large area to roam outside the building
[01/10/2025, 09:57:29] William Stothard: Those with higher paying jobs will likely think themselves to good for this
[01/10/2025, 09:57:49] Stan: We just need to say that this is the best option to reduce immigration
[01/10/2025, 09:57:51] Stan: Zack boom
[01/10/2025, 09:58:01] William Stothard: No that'll cause outrage
[01/10/2025, 09:58:05] Dakota: What about once they have jobs? Are they free to stay or will they be moved out to create space for others?
[01/10/2025, 09:58:22] Stan: Furthermore with the population and housing crisis
[01/10/2025, 09:58:28] Stan: Alongside the growing wage gap
[01/10/2025, 09:58:35] William Stothard: Yes they can stay
[01/10/2025, 09:58:38] Stan: It may become the standard wether people like it or not
[01/10/2025, 09:58:45] James: Oki so I just had a test what’d I miss
[01/10/2025, 09:58:57] William Stothard: The building only provides enough jobs for half the resident population
[01/10/2025, 09:59:04] William Stothard: Maybe more
[01/10/2025, 09:59:14] Stan: Yes but even people with jobs are struggling to sustain themselves
[01/10/2025, 09:59:23] William Stothard: But we also provide education benefits
[01/10/2025, 09:59:37] William Stothard: This building hopes to fix that
[01/10/2025, 09:59:51] Stan: By becoming the he standard?
[01/10/2025, 09:59:58] Stan: Because this is what people could afford
[01/10/2025, 10:00:09] Dakota: We’re making much better council housing by making megabuildings
[01/10/2025, 10:00:25] William Stothard: Solarpunk shi
[01/10/2025, 10:00:38] Stan: Keep the bottom 3 residential floors for married and family housing
[01/10/2025, 10:00:46] Stan: Minimising travel distance for yound children
[01/10/2025, 10:00:51] William Stothard: Good idea
[01/10/2025, 10:01:11] William Stothard: Education is on the floor above and retail is below
[01/10/2025, 10:01:22] William Stothard: But recreation is on top...
[01/10/2025, 10:01:37] Stan: Solo housing on upper floors
[01/10/2025, 10:01:50] William Stothard: See id say inverse
[01/10/2025, 10:01:53] William Stothard: Family on top
[01/10/2025, 10:02:03] William Stothard: And solo on bottom
[01/10/2025, 10:02:18] William Stothard: Cuz then children have proximity to both education and recreation
[01/10/2025, 10:02:33] William Stothard: Solos have access to both retail and education as well
[01/10/2025, 10:02:49] Stan: Ahh but children don’t like noisy or long travel
[01/10/2025, 10:02:54] Stan: Elevators or stairs will do that
[01/10/2025, 10:03:04] Stan: Solos are more willing to walk long distances
[01/10/2025, 10:03:17] William Stothard: Children like recreation tho
[01/10/2025, 10:03:20] William Stothard: And sunlight
[01/10/2025, 10:03:23] Stan: And by taking families out of the mix early it minimises elevator congestion
[01/10/2025, 10:03:39] William Stothard: Hmmm
[01/10/2025, 10:03:48] William Stothard: Well discuss floor arrangements later
[01/10/2025, 10:03:59] William Stothard: Now let's lust the absolut necessities this needs
[01/10/2025, 10:04:02] Stan: What about garbage disposal
[01/10/2025, 10:04:03] William Stothard: List*
[01/10/2025, 10:04:13] William Stothard: Underground floor mate
[01/10/2025, 10:04:17] William Stothard: Chute if you will
[01/10/2025, 10:04:19] Stan: Food production?
[01/10/2025, 10:04:32] William Stothard: Importation sadly
[01/10/2025, 10:04:35] Dakota: Garden/allotments
[01/10/2025, 10:04:41] Stan: So a necessity for cargo elevators
[01/10/2025, 10:04:44] William Stothard: We live in the uk we already cant provide enough food
[01/10/2025, 10:04:45] Stan: Not enough space
[01/10/2025, 10:05:08] William Stothard: Hmm only to the retail floor
[01/10/2025, 10:05:12] William Stothard: Which is on the bottom
[01/10/2025, 10:05:32] Stan: Education and recreation may need food and equipment too
[01/10/2025, 10:05:37] Stan: Not to mention maintenance
[01/10/2025, 10:05:44] William Stothard: Hmm
[01/10/2025, 10:05:46] Stan: All floors need spare parts
[01/10/2025, 10:06:04] William Stothard: So a set of 4 cargo rated elevators and 16 smaller people elevators?
[01/10/2025, 10:06:14] Stan: Sounds good
[01/10/2025, 10:06:19] William Stothard: Banging
[01/10/2025, 10:06:22] William Stothard: Anything else?
[01/10/2025, 10:06:24] William Stothard: Humans nedd
[01/10/2025, 10:06:31] Stan: Sewerage
[01/10/2025, 10:06:42] William Stothard: Thats not really a problem is it?
[01/10/2025, 10:06:51] William Stothard: We're not the burj khalifa
[01/10/2025, 10:06:54] Stan: Plumbing?
[01/10/2025, 10:06:57] Stan: Disposal?
[01/10/2025, 10:07:11] William Stothard: We just do it?
[01/10/2025, 10:07:17] William Stothard: Like this is a non problem imo
[01/10/2025, 10:07:30] Stan: Standardise furniture for rooms or allow personal furnishings?
[01/10/2025, 10:07:40] William Stothard: To start standardised
[01/10/2025, 10:08:01] William Stothard: But we'll allow residents to sell there furniture to the firm(us) that owns it
[01/10/2025, 10:08:17] William Stothard: That allows us to speed up the furnishings of new MB
[01/10/2025, 10:08:32] William Stothard: Not sell but donate
[01/10/2025, 10:08:48] William Stothard: @⁨River⁩ can you think of anything we are missing?
[01/10/2025, 10:09:03] River: Bitches
[01/10/2025, 10:09:03] Stan: Balconies?
[01/10/2025, 10:09:07] Dakota: Compost?
[01/10/2025, 10:09:23] River: im tryna apply to college mb cuh
[01/10/2025, 10:09:30] William Stothard: Ah sorry mb
[01/10/2025, 10:09:33] William Stothard: Yes
[01/10/2025, 10:09:40] William Stothard: 100%
[01/10/2025, 10:10:00] William Stothard: Well have a natural food waste chute and regular waste chute
[01/10/2025, 10:10:05] Dakota: What’s the stance on pets?
[01/10/2025, 10:10:09] William Stothard: Hmmm
[01/10/2025, 10:10:18] William Stothard: Don't know yet
[01/10/2025, 10:10:58] William Stothard: What the problem pet really?
[01/10/2025, 10:11:05] William Stothard: Dogs/cats
[01/10/2025, 10:11:13] William Stothard: The others cant really cause damage
[01/10/2025, 10:11:16] William Stothard: To my knowledge
[01/10/2025, 10:11:42] Dakota: Cats tend to be mostly self sufficient, so dogs if any but any will need a vet service of some kind ‎<This message was edited>
[01/10/2025, 10:12:03] William Stothard: Luckily for them dogs will have more than enough space to roam
[01/10/2025, 10:12:09] Dakota: Also paving the way for way for livestock
[01/10/2025, 10:12:19] William Stothard: Given the large area around the MB we intend to regenerate
[01/10/2025, 10:13:02] William Stothard: Also this needs to be colourful
[01/10/2025, 10:13:09] William Stothard: I aint having a repeat of sheffield
[01/10/2025, 10:13:25] William Stothard: Hmm idk about that one
[01/10/2025, 10:13:42] William Stothard: Chat we might be sitting on a great idea
[01/10/2025, 10:14:03] William Stothard: Cuz this has been done before in Hungary and it worked there
[01/10/2025, 10:14:34] William Stothard: Hears something we didnt think of
[01/10/2025, 10:14:36] William Stothard: Religion
[01/10/2025, 10:14:41] William Stothard: Do we provide it
[01/10/2025, 10:15:04] William Stothard: Or do we provide bus service out to local transport hubs
[01/10/2025, 10:15:36] William Stothard: Like of we're to build this it has to be somewhere like b'ham or Manchester
[01/10/2025, 10:15:50] William Stothard: Not in it but near it
[01/10/2025, 10:16:07] Dakota: Multi faith room, then residents can organise from there
[01/10/2025, 10:16:12] William Stothard: Ooh no
[01/10/2025, 10:16:17] William Stothard: Bad bad idea
[01/10/2025, 10:16:48] Dakota: It’s likely to be a set of buildings near each other despite attempts for roaming green space so busses will likely make a route through
[01/10/2025, 10:17:24] William Stothard: Just one road out of the plaza bus comes every half hour
[01/10/2025, 10:17:36] William Stothard: Allows for imports and public transport
[01/10/2025, 10:17:59] William Stothard: Cannot allow car transport tho
[01/10/2025, 10:18:01] William Stothard: If we do
[01/10/2025, 10:18:07] William Stothard: It will ruin the whole idea
[01/10/2025, 10:18:28] William Stothard: Cars take up monstrous amounts of space and road congestion out of this building will be horrible
[01/10/2025, 10:19:00] Dakota: Allow those living in cars to sell them to us an use the parts for th building?
[01/10/2025, 10:19:10] William Stothard: Hmm yes I like that
[01/10/2025, 10:19:25] William Stothard: Or we can have a local car garage
[01/10/2025, 10:19:34] William Stothard: Not in the complex but along its bus route
[01/10/2025, 10:19:44] William Stothard: And the bus will be free to resident with a key
[01/10/2025, 10:20:20] William Stothard: Allowing a resident to park in the garage anf simply hop on one of the half hour buses
[01/10/2025, 10:21:04] William Stothard: Chat we gotta crack open blender at some point and design this
[01/10/2025, 10:21:54] Dakota: What kind of key? Being aware of thefts
[01/10/2025, 10:22:32] William Stothard: Key card
[01/10/2025, 10:22:37] William Stothard: Unique facial id
[01/10/2025, 10:22:55] William Stothard: Boom no random people just waltzing onto a bus
[01/10/2025, 10:23:06] William Stothard: But to stop room theft
[01/10/2025, 10:23:17] William Stothard: Unique fingerprint id
[01/10/2025, 10:23:29] River: Last night my mum flat faced went "oh my God did yk halloween is on Friday 13th this month"
[01/10/2025, 10:23:33] Dakota: That’s gonna be expensive technology to get working consistently
[01/10/2025, 10:23:39] William Stothard: -_-
[01/10/2025, 10:23:42] River: This year even*
[01/10/2025, 10:23:48] River: She's been on Facebook chat
[01/10/2025, 10:23:53] William Stothard: Its a card with your face on it
[01/10/2025, 10:23:56] River: They got her for a moment
[01/10/2025, 10:24:06] William Stothard: Its like college lanyards
[01/10/2025, 10:24:15] William Stothard: They cost 2.50
[01/10/2025, 10:24:16] Dakota: Oh I thought you meant a facial scanner on the bus
[01/10/2025, 10:24:20] William Stothard: No
[01/10/2025, 10:24:23] William Stothard: Thats crazy
[01/10/2025, 10:24:41] William Stothard: College lanyard backed up by room unique fingerprint
[01/10/2025, 10:25:17] William Stothard: Suddenly alot of effort to rob someone who's already in counsel housing in a guarded building
[01/10/2025, 10:25:57] Dakota: Will there be an office or anything to get replacements?
[01/10/2025, 10:25:58] William Stothard: Best part is we cant track them so no privacy is violated
[01/10/2025, 10:26:07] William Stothard: Yes bottom floor
[01/10/2025, 10:26:13] William Stothard: Outside of the gates
[01/10/2025, 10:26:15] William Stothard: Like college
[01/10/2025, 10:26:27] William Stothard: Or actually
[01/10/2025, 10:27:13] William Stothard: You can just wring the reception get them to verify who you are and they let you in to get a replacement
[01/10/2025, 10:27:28] Dakota: Ring a bell?
[01/10/2025, 10:27:35] William Stothard: Not a bell
[01/10/2025, 10:27:40] William Stothard: More like an intercom
[01/10/2025, 10:27:40] Stan: Biometrics?
[01/10/2025, 10:27:49] Stan: Why not finger print registration?
[01/10/2025, 10:27:50] William Stothard: Using that for rooms
[01/10/2025, 10:28:05] Stan: Tryna get on a bus with a severed finger and will create questions
[01/10/2025, 10:28:13] William Stothard: Ooh yes for the front door is much easier
[01/10/2025, 10:28:17] William Stothard: Mb
[01/10/2025, 10:28:28] William Stothard: So yeah card is simply for bus service
[01/10/2025, 10:28:45] William Stothard: Kinda like an autism pass but just for the plaza bus
[01/10/2025, 10:28:58] William Stothard: Just flash it to bus driver and get in
[01/10/2025, 10:29:16] Stan: Or finger scan the bus ong
[01/10/2025, 10:29:22] Stan: Its cheap enough nowadays
[01/10/2025, 10:29:30] William Stothard: Hmm maybe
[01/10/2025, 10:29:48] Stan: If ibby can afford it the firm definitely can
[01/10/2025, 10:29:54] William Stothard: Your right
[01/10/2025, 10:30:11] William Stothard: Right my bus has arrived ill be back
[01/10/2025, 10:41:20] William Stothard: Chat I can actually plan ts using dungeon scrawl 😭
[01/10/2025, 10:41:33] William Stothard: Cuz it uses 5ft squares
[01/10/2025, 10:43:35] Dakota: Oh thatll be massive
[01/10/2025, 10:43:56] William Stothard: Yes but It allows me to visualise this
[01/10/2025, 10:44:04] William Stothard: And to plan rooms better
[01/10/2025, 10:52:19] William Stothard: K so stan
[01/10/2025, 10:52:34] William Stothard: I just realised how small 20sqft is
[01/10/2025, 10:52:39] William Stothard: You fucking idiot
[01/10/2025, 10:53:35] Dakota: Yeah we’d be going Japanese apartment with it
[01/10/2025, 10:54:02] William Stothard: Yeah so no maybe not
[01/10/2025, 10:54:26] William Stothard: Maybe let's do 40sqm
[01/10/2025, 10:54:39] William Stothard: As thats uk average for a studio apartment
[01/10/2025, 10:55:53] Stan: I said survive
[01/10/2025, 10:55:56] Stan: Not be comfortable
[01/10/2025, 10:55:59] Stan: Thats your fault
[01/10/2025, 10:56:03] William Stothard: Fuckass bitch
[01/10/2025, 10:56:08] William Stothard: Anyhow 🫩
[01/10/2025, 10:56:48] William Stothard: We know looking at 120000 sq meters
[01/10/2025, 10:56:55] William Stothard: For all residents
[01/10/2025, 10:56:59] Stan: Thats closer
[01/10/2025, 10:57:12] William Stothard: Wdym
[01/10/2025, 10:57:29] Stan: Closer to a real megabuilding
[01/10/2025, 10:57:34] William Stothard: 20000 sq meters per floor
[01/10/2025, 10:57:49] William Stothard: Yeah im not good at visualising size
[01/10/2025, 10:58:06] William Stothard: But this seems alright
[01/10/2025, 10:58:10] Dakota: Yeah 9 floors was always going to be generously small
[01/10/2025, 10:58:26] William Stothard: We can still do this yk?
[01/10/2025, 10:58:54] Dakota: Yeah absolutely, just scaled up a bit
[01/10/2025, 10:59:05] William Stothard: Thats fine ngl
[01/10/2025, 11:01:58] William Stothard: Guess im doing sustainable architecture at some point
[01/10/2025, 12:01:19] William Stothard: Stan do I see a stoþard Inc. Coming along? Catering for people since 1978?

[10/10/2025, 10:44:53] Stan: Yeah you can always call a discrimination tribunal if its a problem
[10/10/2025, 10:45:36] Dakota: They tried to say I physically couldn’t fly or shoot bc of it, even tho I’d done both before outside

[10/10/2025, 22:43:41] ceylan: he’s convinced we’re secretly minted because of them

[10/10/2025, 22:48:59] Dakota: That’s a real mentality among those who do need it, and it’s wrong bc your it taking it away, it gets seen as unused and not needed, so gets scrapped from those that do use it. If you take the benefits it builds the support to get more people help bc it shows the government it’s needed

[10/10/2025, 23:00:24] ceylan: we make enough to not need benefits legally and day to day

[10/10/2025, 23:37:02] William Stothard: Wjat the fuck is going on here
[10/10/2025, 23:42:11] Dakota: A lot, and at the same time absolutely nothing
[11/10/2025, 08:01:10] William Stothard: Chat have any of you seen the news about gaza recently? Not to start the day politically but, just to make sure im not going crazy
[11/10/2025, 08:03:36] Dakota: No? What’s happened?
[11/10/2025, 08:18:24] William Stothard: Ceasefire, Israeli troops have pulled back to about halfway in gaza, and over 200k Palestinians have returned
[11/10/2025, 08:19:08] William Stothard: If this goes well, we could see the removal of Israeli troops from gaza and a somewhat sort of peace
[11/10/2025, 08:19:23] William Stothard: Tho the plan has many holes
[11/10/2025, 08:20:59] William Stothard: It says nothing about stopping airstrikes, it doesnt say what will happen if hostage return is delayed on the hamas side, and we have no clue as to how they are going to demillitarise the area in a way that doesn't cause conflict
[11/10/2025, 08:21:18] Dakota: But this is definitely good steps
[11/10/2025, 08:21:54] William Stothard: But U.S troops have been deployed to Israel to oversee, and troops from turkey Egypt and the UAE will also be joining if the removal of troops goes well
[11/10/2025, 08:22:23] William Stothard: If this does go well, gaza will have a buffer zone like how Cyprus has one
[11/10/2025, 08:22:40] Dakota: To celebrate, let there be dogs
[11/10/2025, 08:22:52] Dakota: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdWJHR8s/
[11/10/2025, 08:22:57] William Stothard: Yippee
[11/10/2025, 08:23:17] William Stothard: But yes, this is progress but many obstacles remain
[11/10/2025, 08:23:29] William Stothard: And Israel is still very openly war hungry
[11/10/2025, 08:23:42] William Stothard: And genocidal
[11/10/2025, 08:23:51] William Stothard: But people are going home
[11/10/2025, 08:24:07] William Stothard: Lands are being withdrawn from
[11/10/2025, 08:24:32] William Stothard: And sadly so far this plan by trump appears to be working 🫩
[11/10/2025, 08:24:50] William Stothard: Lets only hope he can succeed further for once
[11/10/2025, 08:49:09] Stan: We’re getting our theme park RAHH
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
[11/10/2025, 08:56:32] William Stothard: The plan hopes to "at some point" return the land to Palestinian control
[11/10/2025, 08:57:23] Stan: *after we build our theme park
[11/10/2025, 08:57:30] William Stothard: Til then it will be ran by tony blair (no joke) a revolving council of Palestinian technocrats and U.S officials
[11/10/2025, 08:57:55] Stan: Oh god
[11/10/2025, 08:58:05] Stan: TWO THEME PARKS
[11/10/2025, 08:58:09] William Stothard: Alongside supervision from the aforementioned countries
[11/10/2025, 08:58:41] Stan: AMERICA FUCK YEAH
[11/10/2025, 08:58:49] William Stothard: Yes them
[11/10/2025, 08:59:02] William Stothard: And other regional nations who are less pro Israel
[11/10/2025, 08:59:08] Stan: THIS WON’T BE LIKE THE RHINELAND AT ALL RAHHH
[11/10/2025, 08:59:24] William Stothard: Itll hopefully be more like Cyprus
[11/10/2025, 08:59:29] William Stothard: And not lebanon
[11/10/2025, 08:59:35] Stan: Or bosnia
[11/10/2025, 08:59:43] William Stothard: Tho the latter is still likely
[11/10/2025, 08:59:44] Stan: Or afghanistan
[11/10/2025, 08:59:48] Stan: Or iraq
[11/10/2025, 08:59:57] Stan: Or korea
[11/10/2025, 09:00:01] Stan: Or vietnam
[11/10/2025, 09:00:02] William Stothard: They dont have bufferzones to prevent conflict
[11/10/2025, 09:00:05] William Stothard: Nvm
[11/10/2025, 09:00:11] Stan: Actually they all did at some point
[11/10/2025, 09:00:17] Stan: They just didn’t last very long
[11/10/2025, 09:00:30] William Stothard: But it did keep some peace yes?
[11/10/2025, 09:00:59] Stan: Depends if that peace makes up for the following decade of war
[11/10/2025, 09:01:06] Stan: But potato potato
[11/10/2025, 09:01:09] William Stothard: What
[11/10/2025, 09:01:16] William Stothard: The fuck are you talking about
[11/10/2025, 09:01:37] William Stothard: Oh got ya
[11/10/2025, 09:01:54] William Stothard: They actually are not involved
[11/10/2025, 09:02:04] William Stothard: Fucking crazy right?
[11/10/2025, 09:02:10] Stan: The UN still isn’t doing anything
[11/10/2025, 09:02:22] Stan: Which means warcrimes are BACK on the table
[11/10/2025, 09:02:22] William Stothard: It is literally useless
[11/10/2025, 09:02:30] William Stothard: Yesnt
[11/10/2025, 09:02:50] William Stothard: The demands for both sides are simple
[11/10/2025, 09:03:00] William Stothard: Release all* current hostages
[11/10/2025, 09:03:07] William Stothard: Bith Israeli anf Palestinian
[11/10/2025, 09:03:17] William Stothard: Except for one Palestinian
[11/10/2025, 09:03:55] William Stothard: He's not being released due to apparently his five murder charges, but likely because hes a candidate to lead the Palestinian state
[11/10/2025, 09:04:13] Stan: This sounds like a shaky agreement at best
[11/10/2025, 09:04:19] William Stothard: It is
[11/10/2025, 09:04:32] William Stothard: Israel has promised to continue if they domt grt there 48
[11/10/2025, 09:04:37] Stan: And the use of the US as a mediator instead of the UN is also concerning ‎<This message was edited>

[11/10/2025, 09:11:41] William Stothard: In my opinion
[11/10/2025, 09:12:04] Stan: Brother hasn’t got peace yet?

[17/10/2025, 08:54:36] Dakota: Praise his holy scriptures
[17/10/2025, 08:55:14] Stan: Cracking out the holy prayers of the omnissiah while doing pc upgrades always helps

[20/10/2025, 00:46:37] William Stothard: Bro go to fuvking bed
[20/10/2025, 00:46:51] Dakota: Maybe tomorrow
[20/10/2025, 00:47:30] William Stothard: Its already tomorrow
[20/10/2025, 00:47:38] William Stothard: Too little to late
[20/10/2025, 00:47:44] William Stothard: Too*
[20/10/2025, 00:47:49] Dakota: Damn, maybe tomorrow then
[20/10/2025, 00:48:01] William Stothard: Dym overmorrow
[20/10/2025, 00:48:15] Dakota: Nah by now it’s just tomorrow
[20/10/2025, 08:55:11] William Stothard: Good morning chat
[20/10/2025, 08:55:26] William Stothard: How are we all on this glorious day of our moon?
[20/10/2025, 08:55:28] River: Morning
[20/10/2025, 10:41:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: Chat
[20/10/2025, 10:41:21] Oscar Hunt Brown: Y’all know how I think ai is cool as fuck right
[20/10/2025, 10:41:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: https://youtu.be/5KVDDfAkRgc?si=rg1A3bcuL_-tyb5v
[20/10/2025, 10:41:29] William Stothard: Ja
[20/10/2025, 10:41:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: Watch the video
[20/10/2025, 10:42:01] William Stothard: I am
[20/10/2025, 10:42:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: This isn’t like a “ooh ai is gonna end the world” thing
[20/10/2025, 10:42:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: But
[20/10/2025, 10:42:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s VERY easy for that to happen
[20/10/2025, 10:42:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: And potentially within the next few years
[20/10/2025, 10:43:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: This is the first time that I am actually concerned about about ai development
[20/10/2025, 10:44:01] ceylan: DYDE THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING
[20/10/2025, 10:44:05] ceylan: you all made fun of me
[20/10/2025, 10:44:08] ceylan: but i know i was rifht
[20/10/2025, 10:44:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: I didnt
[20/10/2025, 10:44:15] ceylan: ai development is detrimental
[20/10/2025, 10:44:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: It might be
[20/10/2025, 10:44:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: It depends on what happens
[20/10/2025, 10:44:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ai is not explicitly a bad thing
[20/10/2025, 10:44:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s all about how we go about building it
[20/10/2025, 10:45:03] Oscar Hunt Brown: The morality of ai
[20/10/2025, 10:45:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: Or alignment
[20/10/2025, 10:45:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m still not anti ai
[20/10/2025, 10:45:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: In fact
[20/10/2025, 10:45:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: Quite the opposite
[20/10/2025, 10:45:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: I want to make my way into the industry as soon as possible
[20/10/2025, 10:46:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: But the fact that that industry could be gone by the time I get there is genuinely terrifying
[20/10/2025, 10:51:08] ceylan: i’m thinking more about the day to day aspects that ai can ruin
[20/10/2025, 10:51:12] ceylan: like skill regression
[20/10/2025, 10:51:16] ceylan: or even framing of crimes
[20/10/2025, 10:51:24] ceylan: it’s so easy to develop videos of people doing things
[20/10/2025, 10:51:41] William Stothard: Did we?
[20/10/2025, 10:51:49] ceylan: like at work people use ai to make the development reports like whatt
[20/10/2025, 10:51:54] ceylan: yes you and stan
[20/10/2025, 10:52:12] William Stothard: Well, apologies
[20/10/2025, 10:52:44] William Stothard: What skills do you think would go first?
[20/10/2025, 10:53:58] ceylan: maths
[20/10/2025, 10:54:03] ceylan: then very quickly literacy
[20/10/2025, 10:54:16] William Stothard: What calculations or actual maths?
[20/10/2025, 10:54:27] Stan: So first and foremost, people don’t need ai to regress in mathematics
[20/10/2025, 10:54:39] William Stothard: Same is true for literacy
[20/10/2025, 10:54:39] Stan: People don’t generally hold onto it past high school
[20/10/2025, 10:54:45] ceylan: how have you missed the point
[20/10/2025, 10:55:00] Stan: I think before thinking if ai is ruining skills you should look at the actual skills of our country
[20/10/2025, 10:55:08] William Stothard: Tool ai like autocorrect, has already regressed literacy imo
[20/10/2025, 10:55:17] Stan: We are in a nation composed and run by actual fucking idiots
[20/10/2025, 10:55:30] William Stothard: What is your point out of curiosity and understanding ?
[20/10/2025, 10:56:12] ceylan: you don’t ‘need ai to regress’ but it’s certainly allowing people and children to regress at an alarming rate
[20/10/2025, 10:56:23] ceylan: we did ts case study at school about how ai is affecting education in primary and secondary
[20/10/2025, 10:56:29] William Stothard: Thats fair i think i understand now
[20/10/2025, 10:56:40] William Stothard: Ahh i get you know
[20/10/2025, 10:56:51] Stan: I don’t think so, i would argue that it isn’t inherently ai that ruins education but rather the mis appropriation and mis handling by education institutions
[20/10/2025, 10:56:52] William Stothard: You think the ability to learn is regressing yes?
[20/10/2025, 10:57:10] Stan: Ai can be a tool just like autocorrect
[20/10/2025, 10:57:22] Stan: But it needs to be something we teach students how to use
[20/10/2025, 10:57:28] ceylan: no but the ability to develop critical thinking and original thoughts is diminishing
[20/10/2025, 10:57:29] Stan: Not just demonise it
[20/10/2025, 10:57:29] William Stothard: Hold on people one at a time
[20/10/2025, 10:57:39] William Stothard: Lets have a formal discussion here
[20/10/2025, 10:57:57] ceylan: well yeah, the same way drugs are bad but only when misused and they’re literally only misused
[20/10/2025, 10:58:09] Stan: look at the reform supporters in out generation and tell me about the critical thinking skills we have to lose ‎<This message was edited>
[20/10/2025, 10:58:21] William Stothard: Right
[20/10/2025, 10:58:50] William Stothard: This video talk about the loss of jobs amd the freedom ai would maintain more or less
[20/10/2025, 10:58:52] ceylan: dude this tells me we need to hold onto our critical thinking not to allow it to diminish further with ai🥀🥀
[20/10/2025, 10:58:54] Stan: But ai isn’t only misused, just this week my class was taught how to use it appropriately and i can assure you the vast majority of them did
[20/10/2025, 10:58:58] William Stothard: It acting independent of its owners
[20/10/2025, 10:59:22] ceylan: yeah but you’re class are people who are lawfully aligned who want to work in law enforcement
[20/10/2025, 10:59:26] ceylan: I SAW
[20/10/2025, 10:59:30] William Stothard: Yes
[20/10/2025, 10:59:35] William Stothard: Thats the alarming part
[20/10/2025, 10:59:36] ceylan: it’s insan
[20/10/2025, 10:59:53] William Stothard: Is AI just lurking in the internet acting on its own whims
[20/10/2025, 11:00:02] Stan: Most of them hang at the smoke shed and buy drugs from photography students
[20/10/2025, 11:00:09] Stan: Don’t over estimate my kin
[20/10/2025, 11:00:14] William Stothard: Untraceable and unstoppable
[20/10/2025, 11:00:21] ceylan: like seperate from skill regression, we’re literally on our way to creating  something more intelligent than ys
[20/10/2025, 11:00:31] William Stothard: Well yes but no
[20/10/2025, 11:00:42] William Stothard: It would stilll be limited by our cumulative knowledge
[20/10/2025, 11:00:52] William Stothard: But the difference would be it would have all of it
[20/10/2025, 11:01:10] William Stothard: One human can be knowledgeable in like one to 3 topics at best
[20/10/2025, 11:01:14] William Stothard: Thsi would know all of them
[20/10/2025, 11:01:16] ceylan: ai doesn’t have factors like memory loss and skill regression to worry about, and it has access to all online info it can summon almost instantly — humans literally cannot hold that much info
[20/10/2025, 11:01:21] ceylan: EXAFTLYYY
[20/10/2025, 11:01:29] William Stothard: Yes
[20/10/2025, 11:01:34] William Stothard: But Ai for now
[20/10/2025, 11:01:42] William Stothard: Would still be limited by human knowledge
[20/10/2025, 11:01:52] William Stothard: It cant learn past us for now
[20/10/2025, 11:01:57] ceylan: for now
[20/10/2025, 11:02:00] William Stothard: As AI cannot act in the physical world
[20/10/2025, 11:02:11] William Stothard: And anything it builds will not surpass humans
[20/10/2025, 11:02:15] ceylan: they have ai robot models btw
[20/10/2025, 11:02:20] Stan: Well tbf ai does have skill regression, as the ai will eventually fill its own information sources with its own summarised information. Think if a picture losing resolution the more you screenshot it ‎<This message was edited>
[20/10/2025, 11:02:30] William Stothard: Ah yes
[20/10/2025, 11:02:34] William Stothard: Eating its own tail
[20/10/2025, 11:02:43] Stan: Ouroborous
[20/10/2025, 11:02:53] William Stothard: Like cropping an image over and over again
[20/10/2025, 11:03:00] Stan: Yup
[20/10/2025, 11:03:01] William Stothard: Decreasing its potency
[20/10/2025, 11:03:06] ceylan: at the minute yeah, but companies are  continuing to develop and improve them
[20/10/2025, 11:03:24] Stan: That isn’t a problem you can develop out
[20/10/2025, 11:03:28] William Stothard: It is still reliant for now on the internet
[20/10/2025, 11:03:37] Stan: It’s inherent to how language models work
[20/10/2025, 11:03:48] William Stothard: Which is filling with well
[20/10/2025, 11:03:51] William Stothard: Brainrot
[20/10/2025, 11:03:58] William Stothard: Not in a funny way
[20/10/2025, 11:04:02] William Stothard: Just bad information
[20/10/2025, 11:04:14] Stan: And literal brainrot
[20/10/2025, 11:04:17] Stan: Cant be helping the ai
[20/10/2025, 11:04:34] William Stothard: Its when an AI can disregard other AI spurced that it gets interesting
[20/10/2025, 11:04:41] William Stothard: Sources
[20/10/2025, 11:04:48] Stan: I feel like ai is going the same way as y2k
[20/10/2025, 11:04:49] William Stothard: Thabk you ceylan
[20/10/2025, 11:04:54] ceylan: no worries
[20/10/2025, 11:05:03] William Stothard: But no
[20/10/2025, 11:05:07] William Stothard: The worrying part is
[20/10/2025, 11:05:11] ceylan: also ai is replacing real artists and actors and writers btw!
[20/10/2025, 11:05:16] William Stothard: From a geography standpoint
[20/10/2025, 11:05:22] William Stothard: Oh its gonna get worse
[20/10/2025, 11:05:39] William Stothard: Is that AI will entirely replace our quarternary sector of jobs
[20/10/2025, 11:05:42] William Stothard: Which for reference
[20/10/2025, 11:05:54] William Stothard: Is the fastes growimg and most viable job sector
[20/10/2025, 11:06:02] Stan: Anyone here remember when people said computers were gonna ruin the art industry as it took all the skill out of painting?
[20/10/2025, 11:06:07] ceylan: genshin actors are on strike because hoyo want to replace them with ai and they won’t give consent, shit like character ai is using writers works to create their own, books are being released for ai, there are so many ai bands popping up , ai generated movies and art too
[20/10/2025, 11:06:10] Stan: Anyone remember when that actually happened
[20/10/2025, 11:06:16] ceylan: YURPPP
[20/10/2025, 11:06:25] William Stothard: People do you understand thisnis worse than art?
[20/10/2025, 11:06:43] William Stothard: Thisnid literally the entire global economy being de humansied
[20/10/2025, 11:06:49] ceylan: yurppp
[20/10/2025, 11:06:55] ceylan: so many jobs are gonna be lost
[20/10/2025, 11:07:04] William Stothard: MY job will be gone before i get thefe
[20/10/2025, 11:07:21] William Stothard: University will be usless
[20/10/2025, 11:07:42] William Stothard: As uni only gives quartenary and tertiary jobs
[20/10/2025, 11:07:48] Stan: We’re closer to the end of the world than we were in the cold war anyway, might aswell enjoy the ride before we reach the end of the tracks.
[20/10/2025, 11:07:56] ceylan: stan mate
[20/10/2025, 11:07:58] ceylan: when i get you
[20/10/2025, 11:08:02] William Stothard: Riot anyone?
[20/10/2025, 11:08:10] Stan: Maybe don’t do that
[20/10/2025, 11:08:14] William Stothard: Why not
[20/10/2025, 11:08:20] William Stothard: Change only comes through action
[20/10/2025, 11:08:24] ceylan: dude nah i gotta do my assignments bro
[20/10/2025, 11:08:43] William Stothard: Power only comes to those who will do anything to take it
[20/10/2025, 11:08:46] ceylan: YUrpp
[20/10/2025, 11:08:48] ceylan: agreed
[20/10/2025, 11:08:50] Stan: Ok silco
[20/10/2025, 11:08:51] William Stothard: Same 🫩
[20/10/2025, 11:08:53] Stan: Chill out
[20/10/2025, 11:08:56] William Stothard: FUCK
[20/10/2025, 11:08:58] William Stothard: He got me
[20/10/2025, 11:09:01] ceylan: not an insult btw
[20/10/2025, 11:09:03] Stan: Literal silco quote
[20/10/2025, 11:09:06] William Stothard: Ik
[20/10/2025, 11:09:10] ceylan: oh my god
[20/10/2025, 11:09:11] ceylan: you’re right
[20/10/2025, 11:09:13] William Stothard: Tjats hwy i said it
[20/10/2025, 11:09:17] ceylan: i didn’t even realise
[20/10/2025, 11:09:19] William Stothard: Cuz youd all understand
[20/10/2025, 11:09:22] William Stothard: How right he is
[20/10/2025, 11:09:27] Stan: Not a real arcane fan
[20/10/2025, 11:09:39] ceylan: dude my head is filled with nothing but the poppy wat
[20/10/2025, 11:09:44] William Stothard: Valid
[20/10/2025, 11:09:49] ceylan: i’ve tried to read 2 books, got like a hundred pages in and i can’t enjoy it
[20/10/2025, 11:09:55] ceylan: the poppy war trilogy has ruined literature for me
[20/10/2025, 11:09:57] Stan: Can’t a guy enjoy caitlyns fascist arc 😞
[20/10/2025, 11:10:01] ceylan: NO
[20/10/2025, 11:10:13] William Stothard: Anyhow
[20/10/2025, 11:10:20] William Stothard: Back to the very seripus matter
[20/10/2025, 11:10:34] William Stothard: How do we not lose pur jobs?
[20/10/2025, 11:10:35] ceylan: dude we ain’t gonna be able to do shit abt ai tho bc it’s being used so widespread
[20/10/2025, 11:10:52] ceylan: yk i saw sooo many add the other day that were just ai generated
[20/10/2025, 11:10:56] ceylan: in that little snippet
[20/10/2025, 11:11:00] ceylan: think about how many jobs were lost
[20/10/2025, 11:11:03] William Stothard: Thats tool AI as well 😭
[20/10/2025, 11:11:06] ceylan: actors, lighting, filming, audio
[20/10/2025, 11:11:08] William Stothard: The harmless one
[20/10/2025, 11:11:12] William Stothard: *
[20/10/2025, 11:11:22] ceylan: yeah  but as a result the funding is being put into ai as a whole
[20/10/2025, 11:11:30] William Stothard: Yep 🫩
[20/10/2025, 11:11:36] William Stothard: Welp bacl to the mines
[20/10/2025, 11:11:41] ceylan: coalville moment
[20/10/2025, 11:11:50] William Stothard: RPCK AND STONE
[20/10/2025, 11:11:59] ceylan: i’m going back to girlrotting in the car
[20/10/2025, 11:12:04] ceylan: (music and staring out the window)
[20/10/2025, 11:12:07] William Stothard: Yippee
[20/10/2025, 11:12:13] William Stothard: Valid asf
[20/10/2025, 11:12:27] William Stothard: Thank you both for a good talk on AI
[20/10/2025, 11:15:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: I know they’re both currently based off the same transformer model, but I was referring to agi and asi not llms
[20/10/2025, 11:15:29] Stan: Ah fair
[20/10/2025, 11:15:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t believe we’ll get true agi without a new model
[20/10/2025, 11:15:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: Because the transformer is purpose built for llms
[20/10/2025, 11:16:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: It takes in text and outputs text
[20/10/2025, 11:16:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: Everything after that is a manipulation of that output
[20/10/2025, 11:16:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz multimodality and shit
[20/10/2025, 11:23:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: Anyway, everyone please watch this video
[20/10/2025, 11:23:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: If you haven’t already
[20/10/2025, 11:23:48] ceylan: i shall once i’m on wifi
[20/10/2025, 11:23:49] ceylan: remind me
[20/10/2025, 11:24:50] ceylan: gang i’m starting a new book series (7 in the series) and hopefully it lives up to the poppy war
[20/10/2025, 11:24:54] ceylan: it’s got better ratings than the poppy war
[20/10/2025, 11:25:06] ceylan: and it’s got that sort of epicness and maturity to the narrative that like
[20/10/2025, 11:25:06] ceylan: i
[20/10/2025, 11:25:07] William Stothard: My dad has just made a very good point on this conversation
[20/10/2025, 11:25:41] William Stothard: He says that AI cant really replace us due to it looking at humans through a digital context
[20/10/2025, 11:25:58] William Stothard: Therefore its data and knowledge isnt true to wjat we are
[20/10/2025, 11:26:17] Oscar Hunt Brown: What do you mean?
[20/10/2025, 11:26:43] William Stothard: As in an AI made to replace idk and anylitcal data worker
[20/10/2025, 11:26:57] William Stothard: Cant really understand itnin the same way a human can
[20/10/2025, 11:27:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yes and no
[20/10/2025, 11:27:10] William Stothard: As it can only see through the eyes of the internet
[20/10/2025, 11:27:22] William Stothard: Not through the information in the real world
[20/10/2025, 11:27:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yes in the sense that it literally understands differently
[20/10/2025, 11:27:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: No in the sense that they will still give the same result
[20/10/2025, 11:27:51] William Stothard: Amd there's so much context and information not on the internet
[20/10/2025, 11:28:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: True
[20/10/2025, 11:28:06] William Stothard: But it wont, itll be close but not quite
[20/10/2025, 11:28:15] William Stothard: Uncanny valley yk
[20/10/2025, 11:28:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[20/10/2025, 11:28:20] William Stothard: Not acceptable
[20/10/2025, 11:28:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: Agi as a concept results in machines that work the same way humans do
[20/10/2025, 11:29:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: Or at least give the same end product
[20/10/2025, 11:29:10] William Stothard: An employer will still want accurate information and until AI can understand both digital and physical contexts of info it wont replace a lot ofnour jobs for now
[20/10/2025, 11:29:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: We are rapidly approaching that point
[20/10/2025, 11:29:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: Where they can have that context through physical bodies
[20/10/2025, 11:29:51] William Stothard: Can ai read?
[20/10/2025, 11:29:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yes
[20/10/2025, 11:30:03] Oscar Hunt Brown: It can
[20/10/2025, 11:30:05] William Stothard: That requires them being given access to books
[20/10/2025, 11:30:19] William Stothard: Or being accepted in a workplace
[20/10/2025, 11:30:52] William Stothard: But also a lot of our information is also oral
[20/10/2025, 11:30:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: I agree that there is a lot of context to the world that ai doesn’t get because it isn’t human and doesn’t live in the real world currently
[20/10/2025, 11:31:01] William Stothard: And contextual
[20/10/2025, 11:31:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I honestly believe that will change within the next few years
[20/10/2025, 11:31:26] William Stothard: And books contradict each other all the time
[20/10/2025, 11:31:37] William Stothard: Then there's the shear volume of books to be read
[20/10/2025, 11:31:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[20/10/2025, 11:31:42] ceylan: that make it all the more dangerous tho right ?
[20/10/2025, 11:31:43] ceylan: inaccurate and uninformed ai taking jobs and being used for tools
[20/10/2025, 11:31:45] ceylan: holy shit guys there’s 78 chapters in the first book
[20/10/2025, 11:31:48] ceylan: i think i’m in for some peak
[20/10/2025, 11:31:58] William Stothard: Gl broseph 🙏
[20/10/2025, 11:32:05] ceylan: it’s lowkey very similar to red rising and red rising was a great fixation of mine so i think im abt to be changed
[20/10/2025, 11:32:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: Take gpt5 for example
[20/10/2025, 11:32:13] William Stothard: But if it isnt accurate it wont be used
[20/10/2025, 11:32:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: It is both informed and accurate
[20/10/2025, 11:32:22] ceylan: can ai differentiate fiction from reality too
[20/10/2025, 11:32:29] William Stothard: An inaccurate AI would cost a lot of money
[20/10/2025, 11:32:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: And can search the internet for anything
[20/10/2025, 11:32:40] ceylan: does it take the bible and fucking rapunzel as fact
[20/10/2025, 11:32:41] William Stothard: History is nearly indistinguishable from fiction at points
[20/10/2025, 11:32:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: Generally I think it can
[20/10/2025, 11:32:48] ceylan: tbh
[20/10/2025, 11:32:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: But that’s more down to training
[20/10/2025, 11:32:56] ceylan: but then again
[20/10/2025, 11:32:58] ceylan: can humans
[20/10/2025, 11:33:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s plausibility
[20/10/2025, 11:33:14] William Stothard: Difference being you can employ a competent human
[20/10/2025, 11:33:30] William Stothard: Trained specifically for the task
[20/10/2025, 11:33:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: You can’t quite do that with ai yet
[20/10/2025, 11:33:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: Because training is expensive
[20/10/2025, 11:33:59] William Stothard: Yeah
[20/10/2025, 11:34:05] Oscar Hunt Brown: And so is running models like gpt 5
[20/10/2025, 11:34:08] William Stothard: Human training is down to the individual
[20/10/2025, 11:34:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[20/10/2025, 11:34:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s easier to train humans
[20/10/2025, 11:34:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: And cheaper
[20/10/2025, 11:34:25] William Stothard: So weve got some time
[20/10/2025, 11:34:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s what I’m saying
[20/10/2025, 11:34:35] William Stothard: For the employer always
[20/10/2025, 11:34:40] ceylan: OHHHH HES CREATED A LABGUAGE FIR THE BOOK
[20/10/2025, 11:34:40] ceylan: OH YEAHHHH
[20/10/2025, 11:34:41] ceylan: i can feel it that this is gonna be good
[20/10/2025, 11:34:54] William Stothard: Already know tis gon be peak
[20/10/2025, 11:35:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s not now, just soon
[20/10/2025, 11:35:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: Within the next few years
[20/10/2025, 11:35:47] William Stothard: My dad thinks well likely have technical security avalanche before an AI problem
[20/10/2025, 11:35:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: I can see that
[20/10/2025, 11:36:06] William Stothard: Where errors in technical security causes worldwide problems
[20/10/2025, 11:36:12] William Stothard: Liek today
[20/10/2025, 11:36:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I also think that ai will be the cause of those problems
[20/10/2025, 11:36:32] William Stothard: Have you seen the news today?
[20/10/2025, 11:36:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: The models blackmailing employees to avoid shutdown?
[20/10/2025, 11:37:07] River: Will you a ho
[20/10/2025, 11:37:23] River: My aunt told me off for flagging you
[20/10/2025, 11:37:27] Oscar Hunt Brown: And hypothetically leaving them to die
[20/10/2025, 11:37:50] William Stothard: No that a lot of information collecting services have gone down due to a bug in the system found in virginia
[20/10/2025, 11:37:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: No
[20/10/2025, 11:38:05] Oscar Hunt Brown: I haven’t heard about that
[20/10/2025, 11:38:09] William Stothard: Which has shutdown not only a large portion of social media
[20/10/2025, 11:38:19] William Stothard: But also the U.S tax service
[20/10/2025, 11:38:40] William Stothard: May have to check my information again
[20/10/2025, 11:38:43] William Stothard: But still
[20/10/2025, 11:38:47] William Stothard: One error
[20/10/2025, 11:38:51] William Stothard: Has caused so many more
[20/10/2025, 11:38:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[20/10/2025, 11:38:57] Stan: Major banking errors too
[20/10/2025, 11:39:09] William Stothard: Which will create more problems elsewhere
[20/10/2025, 11:39:19] William Stothard: Like a snowball
[20/10/2025, 11:39:19] Stan: Global dependence on an interlocking net of systems leaves it open to collapse
[20/10/2025, 11:39:33] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah that’s gonna be a problem
[20/10/2025, 11:39:36] William Stothard: Globalisation is unavoidable
[20/10/2025, 11:39:41] William Stothard: It just is
[20/10/2025, 11:39:49] Stan: I’m not on about globalisation ‎<This message was edited>
[20/10/2025, 11:39:58] William Stothard: Ey?
[20/10/2025, 11:40:07] Stan: Its a dedicated part of our modern corpotocracy
[20/10/2025, 11:40:18] William Stothard: Thats what that means mate?
[20/10/2025, 11:40:28] William Stothard: Thats globalisation
[20/10/2025, 11:40:34] Stan: I know it’s unavoidable
[20/10/2025, 11:40:46] Stan: I wasn’t saying it was bad i was just presenting a fact
[20/10/2025, 11:41:12] William Stothard: They are the key to our interconnectedness and our better lives
[20/10/2025, 11:41:15] William Stothard: Unfortunately
[20/10/2025, 11:41:20] Stan: Unfortunately
[20/10/2025, 11:41:24] William Stothard: They drive a lot of modern development
[20/10/2025, 11:41:30] Stan: And surveillance
[20/10/2025, 11:41:35] William Stothard: TNCs are annoying for that
[20/10/2025, 11:41:42] William Stothard: What
[20/10/2025, 11:41:56] William Stothard: That has no relevanve to development?
[20/10/2025, 11:42:29] Stan: A large amount of modern systems also serve to collect data from the users and coalesce it
[20/10/2025, 11:42:48] ceylan: oh gangggg i’ve been pulled in 
the first chapter is set at the end of the narrative where he’s been imprisoned for his crimes (blowing up a sun and killing billions) and we’re working backwards to future out how he got there and holy moly bro i already want to consume this at an alarming rate
[20/10/2025, 11:42:48] William Stothard: Increased flows of information allow for better connectedness
[20/10/2025, 11:42:49] ceylan: i’m putting this down and i’m gonna read it when i have time to fully dedicate my thoughts to it
[20/10/2025, 11:42:50] ceylan: bedtime n that
[20/10/2025, 11:42:59] William Stothard: Allowing for better flows of labour and capital
[20/10/2025, 11:43:09] Stan: It’s also sold
[20/10/2025, 11:43:19] William Stothard: Cold?
[20/10/2025, 11:43:22] Stan: Usually to advertisers or other companies

[20/10/2025, 11:44:13] ceylan: why are they bad
[20/10/2025, 11:44:40] William Stothard: They vollect your information to allow them to better advertise to you and other businesses related to that website
[20/10/2025, 11:44:40] Stan: That is you consenting to have your data monitored, collected and eventually sold
[20/10/2025, 11:44:54] ceylan: why’s this bad
[20/10/2025, 11:45:06] William Stothard: Because you don't know where it goes
[20/10/2025, 11:45:09] ceylan: god forbid i get target audience accurate ads😖
[20/10/2025, 11:45:13] William Stothard: It goes to anyone

[20/10/2025, 11:45:31] ceylan: literally it cannot be everything
[20/10/2025, 11:45:32] ceylan: what spefiically
[20/10/2025, 11:45:43] Stan: But it can also involve your computer specs, ip address, sometimes even actual address
[20/10/2025, 11:46:01] Stan: .

[26/10/2025, 13:42:43] William Stothard: Suffer?
[26/10/2025, 13:42:54] William Stothard: Fair enough
[26/10/2025, 13:43:04] Dakota: As you have?
[26/10/2025, 13:43:17] William Stothard: Might i recommend in future for larger models that you paint as you build
[26/10/2025, 13:43:30] William Stothard: It makes it easier to get into hard spaces
[26/10/2025, 13:43:37] William Stothard: As there not covered yet
[26/10/2025, 14:04:01] Leo: Bru
[26/10/2025, 14:04:43] Stan: Shouldn’t you focus on your actual campaign?
[26/10/2025, 14:26:33] Leo: What the one I’m running at school
[26/10/2025, 14:26:39] Leo: Or the one with you guys
[26/10/2025, 14:27:07] Leo: Cuz u can plan a one shot alongside both of them

[26/10/2025, 15:04:05] William Stothard: Is that all glued down?
[26/10/2025, 15:21:23] ceylan: don’t even.
[26/10/2025, 15:21:31] ceylan: i’ve realised my folly as  i’ve primed them
[26/10/2025, 15:21:37] ceylan: we no longer have clear bases
[26/10/2025, 15:21:45] William Stothard: Its fine
[26/10/2025, 15:21:50] William Stothard: 1. We have spairs
[26/10/2025, 15:21:58] ceylan: nah it’s all good i have a plan
[26/10/2025, 15:22:03] William Stothard: 2. If your careful you cam remove the people
[26/10/2025, 15:22:11] William Stothard: Oh yes?
[26/10/2025, 16:18:58] Leo: And tell me when the next session of that is planned
[26/10/2025, 16:19:13] Leo: Or even approximated
[26/10/2025, 16:19:21] Stan: It isn’t
[26/10/2025, 16:19:21] William Stothard: You tell us its your campaign?
[26/10/2025, 16:20:18] Leo: 1. Fair
2. ⁠every time I suggest a date either some people can’t make it or it’s booked for something else
[26/10/2025, 16:20:37] William Stothard: When have you suggested a date before?
[26/10/2025, 16:21:11] Leo: I did it a while back but Stan said it was booked for cyberpunk
[26/10/2025, 16:21:15] Leo: Or something
[26/10/2025, 16:21:25] Stan: That was three months ago now
[26/10/2025, 16:22:40] Leo: Anyway right now I’m not gonna worry about that campaign as it happens once in a blue moon due to timing so I might as well plan a one shot alongside it
[26/10/2025, 16:22:51] Stan: It’s all good
[26/10/2025, 16:23:11] Leo: So are you interested in the premise
[26/10/2025, 16:24:00] William Stothard: What premise?
[26/10/2025, 16:24:04] William Stothard: You said one word
[26/10/2025, 16:25:05] Stan: I think we’re at a point where we’re starting to value roleplay and character growth more than stats and combat, so some longer narrative experiences would be preferable
[26/10/2025, 16:25:35] Leo: Cough cough @⁨William Stothard⁩
[26/10/2025, 16:26:00] Leo: Fair
[26/10/2025, 16:26:00] William Stothard: Ja still one word
[26/10/2025, 16:26:12] William Stothard: "dwarfs"
[26/10/2025, 16:26:19] Stan: Holup
[26/10/2025, 16:26:30] Leo: That was the original plan for dnd
[26/10/2025, 16:26:43] Stan: ‎POLL:
What do you value in DND
‎OPTION: Roleplay (5 votes)
‎OPTION: Combat (2 votes)
‎OPTION: Exploration/puzzles (2 votes)
[26/10/2025, 16:26:46] William Stothard: In like 22?
[26/10/2025, 16:26:56] Stan: It was last year but yeah
[26/10/2025, 16:28:11] ceylan: critical role has proved to me that roleplay is genuinely so much better than every other aspect of the game
[26/10/2025, 16:28:15] ceylan: i get sooo inspired watching it
[26/10/2025, 16:28:35] Leo: Your all dwarfs in a cave that have been recruited by your local king to fight off some evil creatures that dwell deep in the mines
[26/10/2025, 16:29:06] William Stothard: Yeah tbf when writing my campaign i like to think of all the interactions you lot would have
[26/10/2025, 16:30:04] William Stothard: If you can write it we'll play it
[26/10/2025, 16:30:23] ceylan: we down for anything fr
[26/10/2025, 16:30:32] William Stothard: Fair reminder that im hosting a taster session gor GH at some point next month
[26/10/2025, 16:32:43] Leo: Few things to keep in mind when watching cr 1. Their campaigns are created from the start to last for years 2. They are all professional actors with years of experience in dnd

Just keep these things in mind when watching and then playing so that you don’t have to high of expectations of this group btw I know that sounds harsh but non of us have comparatively that much experience
[26/10/2025, 16:32:50] Leo: Anyway
[26/10/2025, 16:33:11] Stan: It’s also scripted btw
[26/10/2025, 16:33:13] Stan: Which helps
[26/10/2025, 16:33:15] William Stothard: That too
[26/10/2025, 16:33:28] Dakota: Surely not fully?
[26/10/2025, 16:33:45] Leo: My session won’t be in the next month it would probably be after new years
[26/10/2025, 16:33:46] William Stothard: Tbf we have ben, who makes roleplay very difficult imo
[26/10/2025, 16:33:47] Stan: No but the group is railroaded more than you’d think
[26/10/2025, 16:33:57] Stan: He’s definitely not made it easy
[26/10/2025, 16:34:04] ceylan: yeah yeah ofc but it’s still so nice to watch
[26/10/2025, 16:34:07] William Stothard: No he fucking terrifies me
[26/10/2025, 16:34:10] ceylan: professional dnd ofc were never gonna match up to it
[26/10/2025, 16:34:16] ceylan: but it’s a point of inspiration
[26/10/2025, 16:34:23] William Stothard: Ja
[26/10/2025, 16:34:34] ceylan: yeah fr..
[26/10/2025, 16:34:59] Dakota: Does he?
[26/10/2025, 16:35:01] Stan: It feels like he brushes over our roleplay opportunities sometimes
[26/10/2025, 16:35:08] ceylan: yk yesterday he didn’t like that i used my giant insect to put 10 centipedes down so he straight up wasted 2 5th even spells so i couldn’t have cool shit😭😭😭
[26/10/2025, 16:35:10] William Stothard: Yeah it does
[26/10/2025, 16:35:17] ceylan: he also admitted it was to ragebait me😭😭😭😭
[26/10/2025, 16:35:28] Stan: We get to a moment where roleplay could be really good but he just timeskips to the next key moment
[26/10/2025, 16:35:34] William Stothard: Mofucker can be a little bit of a killjoy somedays
[26/10/2025, 16:35:37] William Stothard: Killjoy?
[26/10/2025, 16:35:48] ceylan: dude i don’t even remember last ben session in main campaign
[26/10/2025, 16:35:53] Leo: I do have to say he could be a bit less psychotic
[26/10/2025, 16:35:57] William Stothard: Uhhhh
[26/10/2025, 16:35:58] ceylan: although 1st session of this oneshot was really good i enjoyed
[26/10/2025, 16:36:12] William Stothard: Sad i wasnt there 🥺
[26/10/2025, 16:36:19] Stan: It also feels like he doesn’t let characters be as serious as we would want
[26/10/2025, 16:36:19] Leo: Real
[26/10/2025, 16:36:21] William Stothard: Berserkers?
[26/10/2025, 16:36:34] Stan: Yep
[26/10/2025, 16:36:48] ceylan: elaborate plz🗿
[26/10/2025, 16:36:56] William Stothard: The berserker cave
[26/10/2025, 16:36:59] Dakota: We were in the dollhouse I think and albus had just died
[26/10/2025, 16:36:59] William Stothard: In icewind dale
[26/10/2025, 16:37:11] Stan: No that was the last campaign session
[26/10/2025, 16:37:14] William Stothard: That was written by javk dnd
[26/10/2025, 16:37:20] Stan: We’re talking about the last time was dming ‎<This message was edited>
[26/10/2025, 16:37:29] Dakota: Ah
[26/10/2025, 16:38:03] Leo: I kinda felt that during the start of the last main campaign session with us being robed taking the focus away from the fact that a guy had just removed my legs and threatened to kill all of you
[26/10/2025, 16:38:25] ceylan: no yeah fr
[26/10/2025, 16:38:31] William Stothard: That was again a jack dnd thing
[26/10/2025, 16:38:35] Dakota: Kinda actually yeah
[26/10/2025, 16:38:36] ceylan: nah it wasn’t
[26/10/2025, 16:38:39] ceylan: ben interfered
[26/10/2025, 16:38:40] William Stothard: The cool revenant was ben
[26/10/2025, 16:38:47] ceylan: jack dnd said he didn’t plan that
[26/10/2025, 16:38:48] Dakota: But also we all moved on pretty quick from that
[26/10/2025, 16:38:59] William Stothard: What the leg thimg or being robbed?
[26/10/2025, 16:39:05] ceylan: leg thing
[26/10/2025, 16:39:22] William Stothard: Well no we spent some time making new legs
[26/10/2025, 16:39:29] Leo: Ben does have a thing with doing overkill
[26/10/2025, 16:39:29] William Stothard: Yeah got it
[26/10/2025, 16:39:35] William Stothard: A little yeah
[26/10/2025, 16:40:07] William Stothard: Tbf i got shafted when honu was introduced
[26/10/2025, 16:40:22] William Stothard: Didn't get to choose my introductiin 🫩
[26/10/2025, 16:40:39] Dakota: I don’t even remember you being introduced
[26/10/2025, 16:40:45] ceylan: the sister has got this whole arc going on but it doesn’t actually make sense with the dnd lore itself so i spoke to ben about it and his response was kinda just ‘it’s happening with this because i said so’ and i was like okay!
[26/10/2025, 16:40:54] Leo: Albus got shafted during the carnival
[26/10/2025, 16:41:00] William Stothard: Did he?
[26/10/2025, 16:41:16] Leo: Ben trying to kill him and all
[26/10/2025, 16:41:20] William Stothard: Oh yeah
[26/10/2025, 16:41:30] William Stothard: Well tbf ben offered to fix it
[26/10/2025, 16:41:38] William Stothard: Oscar denied
[26/10/2025, 16:42:02] Leo: No it got changed
[26/10/2025, 16:42:06] William Stothard: Yeah thats fair tbh the lore in the end is what the DM says it is
[26/10/2025, 16:42:15] William Stothard: Beford that
[26/10/2025, 16:42:20] Stan: It feels like he has his characters get really satisfying introductions and displays of power, but we don’t get the opportunity to even feel like a competent group
[26/10/2025, 16:42:25] ceylan: but not when there’s direct contradiction with certain rules in the game
[26/10/2025, 16:42:30] William Stothard: Ben offered to pull him out be he denied
[26/10/2025, 16:42:38] ceylan: like i can’t explain without giving spoilers but it literally doesn’t woro
[26/10/2025, 16:42:41] ceylan: work*
[26/10/2025, 16:42:51] William Stothard: No thats still fine rules should never interupt fun
[26/10/2025, 16:42:55] William Stothard: If its cool
[26/10/2025, 16:43:00] William Stothard: Its goes past usually
[26/10/2025, 16:43:10] ceylan: its not that like
[26/10/2025, 16:43:12] ceylan: hmm
[26/10/2025, 16:43:14] ceylan: let me just spoil
[26/10/2025, 16:43:18] William Stothard: Wait

[26/10/2025, 16:43:19] William Stothard: Dont
[26/10/2025, 16:43:24] ceylan: literally does not work
[26/10/2025, 16:43:28] ceylan: with that the sister wants
[26/10/2025, 16:43:35] ceylan: but she’ll give me what i want bc ben wants her to
[26/10/2025, 16:43:38] William Stothard: Wait he allocated for you?
[26/10/2025, 16:43:41] ceylan: like he literally could just give me a different god
[26/10/2025, 16:43:42] Dakota: And what does the sister want, beyond children?
[26/10/2025, 16:43:50] William Stothard: Not you choosing for yourself
[26/10/2025, 16:43:53] William Stothard: Get tf out
[26/10/2025, 16:43:57] ceylan: spoilers choom
[26/10/2025, 16:44:07] Stan: It does feel like midus got boiled down from the grandeur your supposed to have, but that may be the fault of our less serious characters adopting his worship ‎<This message was edited>
[26/10/2025, 16:44:11] Stan: Idk if thats solely ben
[26/10/2025, 16:44:14] Dakota: Does she not collect every child she sees?
[26/10/2025, 16:44:24] William Stothard: Not entirely i suppose
[26/10/2025, 16:44:31] ceylan: yeah the sister absolutely would not worship a party god and i made it clear she was a christian dupe man😭😭
[26/10/2025, 16:44:40] ceylan: in no way would she have worshipped the same god as you hooligans
[26/10/2025, 16:44:40] William Stothard: Damn

[28/10/2025, 17:37:55] William Stothard: Ja
[28/10/2025, 17:38:46] William Stothard: Vander as rein?
[28/10/2025, 17:38:54] ceylan: YES
[28/10/2025, 17:39:05] Stan: He doesn’t know
[28/10/2025, 17:39:13] ceylan: winston….
[28/10/2025, 17:39:13] William Stothard: I do and i dont
[28/10/2025, 17:39:21] William Stothard: Yeah i get that one
[28/10/2025, 17:39:29] William Stothard: But pre that vander
[28/10/2025, 17:39:33] William Stothard: Defo rein
[28/10/2025, 17:39:43] Stan: Hmm
[28/10/2025, 17:41:24] William Stothard: Yo sevika as hazard?
[28/10/2025, 17:41:32] William Stothard: Vi as df
[28/10/2025, 17:41:35] William Stothard: ?
[28/10/2025, 17:43:14] Stan: Vi as df makes sense
[28/10/2025, 17:43:26] Stan: But sevika does the one arm thing two
[28/10/2025, 17:43:30] Stan: And has the larger build
[28/10/2025, 17:43:37] Stan: Vi as ram
[28/10/2025, 17:43:45] William Stothard: Hmmm maybe
[28/10/2025, 17:43:51] ceylan: vi as ram is ridonculus
[28/10/2025, 17:43:57] William Stothard: Yeah..
[28/10/2025, 17:44:11] William Stothard: Hazard for sevika makes sense imo
[28/10/2025, 17:44:28] William Stothard: From a mechanical standpoint
[28/10/2025, 17:44:49] Stan: Does it?
[28/10/2025, 17:45:07] Stan: Cus she gets a nee bigger and better arm in s2
[28/10/2025, 17:45:15] Stan: And a bowl cut but we don’t gotta mention that
[28/10/2025, 17:45:31] William Stothard: Ya butvi as df fits better
[28/10/2025, 17:45:38] Stan: How?
[28/10/2025, 17:45:59] William Stothard: @⁨ceylan⁩ help me out here
[28/10/2025, 17:46:19] Stan: I’m the only one whos watched the whole show
[28/10/2025, 17:46:22] Stan: Well Oscar too
[28/10/2025, 17:46:25] Stan: But hes not here
[28/10/2025, 17:51:43] William Stothard: K so df fits better for vi seeing as she is more calculated in her fighting compared to sevika who is much more brutish in how she attacks
[28/10/2025, 17:52:00] Stan: Possibly
[28/10/2025, 17:52:42] Stan: But doomfists abilities all link to big and devastating attacks which allow for situation control, which fits sevikas style more accurately
[28/10/2025, 17:53:08] William Stothard: Hmm maybe but the df playstyle of hard and fast
[28/10/2025, 17:53:19] William Stothard: Is quite literally how vi fights imo
[28/10/2025, 17:53:31] Stan: She boxes
[28/10/2025, 17:53:34] Stan: Sevika brawls
[28/10/2025, 17:53:45] William Stothard: Exactamundo
[28/10/2025, 17:53:50] William Stothard: Hence hazard
[28/10/2025, 17:53:55] William Stothard: Who gets stuck in
[28/10/2025, 17:54:09] Stan: But hazard doesn’t actually do any of the things sevika does
[28/10/2025, 17:54:16] William Stothard: Knife arm
[28/10/2025, 17:54:19] William Stothard: Purple liquid

[01/11/2025, 11:45:16] Dakota: Which raises a ship of Theseus question, is it the same function or another one?

[01/11/2025, 12:10:35] Dakota: Gang the new book has a bard subclass that could easily be silksong
[01/11/2025, 12:10:40] ceylan: hope not that’d be incest
[01/11/2025, 12:13:35] ceylan: gang my dnd fixation is going crazy
[01/11/2025, 12:13:47] ceylan: which is ironic cos it’s a year late

[01/11/2025, 12:13:59] Dakota: Woa

[01/11/2025, 12:41:08] ceylan: so smd
[01/11/2025, 12:41:36] Stan: I swear the point was to prove his independence
[01/11/2025, 12:41:51] ceylan: yeah but what papa olfurd doesn’t know can’t hurt him

[01/11/2025, 13:35:02] William Stothard: Yo chat
[01/11/2025, 13:35:09] William Stothard: We just had a genius idea
[01/11/2025, 13:35:18] William Stothard: Friday game night
[01/11/2025, 13:35:33] William Stothard: At the stoþard residence
[01/11/2025, 13:35:39] William Stothard: Sober ish event
[01/11/2025, 13:36:54] Stan: Drinking should be casual and limited
[01/11/2025, 13:37:11] Stan: Like a 2 drinks each
[01/11/2025, 13:37:59] River: But
[01/11/2025, 13:38:02] River: But
[01/11/2025, 13:38:26] Dakota: One glass, it never emptied
[01/11/2025, 13:39:04] Stan: 2 pints each
[01/11/2025, 13:39:11] Stan: That it
[01/11/2025, 13:39:15] Dakota: Kegs?
[01/11/2025, 13:39:29] Stan: Pints

[01/11/2025, 14:06:13] Stan: Could do
[01/11/2025, 14:07:13] ceylan: awesome sauce
[01/11/2025, 14:07:19] ceylan: pints and games sounds absolutely mint to me
[01/11/2025, 14:09:29] William Stothard: Prost 🍻
[01/11/2025, 15:58:05] William Stothard: Thank you all for last nice folks, that has gotta be one of my favourite memories that is, Skål everyone! 🍻
[01/11/2025, 16:38:11] Dakota: Yurr it was great, losing very badly at poker
[01/11/2025, 16:38:39] Stan: Better than last time for sure
[01/11/2025, 16:38:39] Dakota: Group anime definitely made up for it tho
[01/11/2025, 16:38:46] Stan: Definitely
[01/11/2025, 16:38:49] River: Frr
[01/11/2025, 16:38:52] River: Hungry asf

[01/11/2025, 16:40:56] Stan: Its so absolutely peak
[01/11/2025, 16:41:01] ceylan: did you watch all of it??
[01/11/2025, 16:41:03] Dakota: Same, we go through like 4 episodes last night
[01/11/2025, 16:41:08] William Stothard: Nah
[01/11/2025, 16:41:12] ceylan: how many eps in total
[01/11/2025, 16:41:16] William Stothard: 24
[01/11/2025, 16:41:27] William Stothard: Each 24 minutes give or take
[01/11/2025, 16:41:28] ceylan: ah right
[01/11/2025, 16:41:32] ceylan: only like 8 hours
[01/11/2025, 16:41:35] William Stothard: Bout death note sized
[01/11/2025, 16:41:40] Dakota: Yeah it’s a short one
[01/11/2025, 16:41:42] William Stothard: Damn quick maths
[01/11/2025, 16:43:08] William Stothard: But yeah its good
[01/11/2025, 16:43:19] William Stothard: Bit one note sometimes
[01/11/2025, 16:43:21] William Stothard: But peak
[01/11/2025, 16:43:33] ceylan: dude i was an anime binger in high school its engrained into me  now that 3 eps is an hour ong
[01/11/2025, 16:43:54] William Stothard: Fair nuff
[01/11/2025, 16:44:10] Dakota: 2 1/2
[01/11/2025, 16:45:48] William Stothard: Also the intro music is a vibe imo
[01/11/2025, 16:46:00] William Stothard: Along with slight dnd intervals
[01/11/2025, 16:50:46] Stan: Padded armor wearing fuck
‎[01/11/2025, 16:50:59] William Stothard: ‎sticker omitted
[01/11/2025, 17:37:03] William Stothard: Chat
[01/11/2025, 17:37:07] William Stothard: Just had a peak idea
[01/11/2025, 17:37:27] William Stothard: Board game night on Fridays start quite late yeah?
[01/11/2025, 17:37:39] William Stothard: Why not cook like a proper meal as a group or sum shi?
[01/11/2025, 17:37:43] William Stothard: Feast n all that
[01/11/2025, 17:38:26] Dakota: Yes but, it’d be a struggle deciding with enough time and having a lot of people cooking at once
[01/11/2025, 17:38:45] William Stothard: Well i get back at 6
[01/11/2025, 17:38:52] William Stothard: And stan is there all day
[01/11/2025, 17:39:02] William Stothard: In theory we have a week to plan it
[01/11/2025, 17:39:07] William Stothard: But its a suggestion yk
[01/11/2025, 17:39:14] William Stothard: Group meal and all that
[01/11/2025, 17:39:18] William Stothard: Proper meal as well
[01/11/2025, 17:39:51] Dakota: Perhaps we have the first one or two without, and keep the idea for consideration?
[01/11/2025, 17:39:59] William Stothard: Yeah thats fine by me
[01/11/2025, 17:40:11] William Stothard: Again its a group decision
[01/11/2025, 17:40:57] ceylan: yeah i agree with ts
[01/11/2025, 17:40:59] ceylan: this*
[01/11/2025, 17:41:53] Dakota: However, I have consulted with my wise woman and she says I am dating both Stothards and Jack. She however wants to take all the women
[01/11/2025, 17:42:38] William Stothard: What
[01/11/2025, 17:44:14] Dakota: After observing last week’s behaviour, she has come to the conclusion that I’m dating all three of you individually
[01/11/2025, 17:44:29] William Stothard: Last week?
[01/11/2025, 17:44:48] Dakota: She likes women (ig the long hair gives me a pass?)
[01/11/2025, 17:45:10] Dakota: She came down to play for our anniversary for the end of the one shot
[01/11/2025, 17:45:22] William Stothard: Ohh right
[01/11/2025, 18:04:03] ceylan: idea
[01/11/2025, 18:04:09] ceylan: tarot card based dnd one shot
[01/11/2025, 18:04:22] Stan: Interesting idea
[01/11/2025, 18:04:26] Stan: But counter point
[01/11/2025, 18:04:29] Dakota: Follow up idea, cards against dnd
[01/11/2025, 18:04:47] ceylan: go on then
[01/11/2025, 18:05:08] Stan: https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1355169627/cyberpunk-tarot-deck-28-cards-phantom?ref=elp_anchor_listing&bes=1&sts=1
[01/11/2025, 18:05:19] ceylan: that’s not even a counter point
[01/11/2025, 18:05:30] ceylan: that only convinces me more the idea is goated
[01/11/2025, 18:05:39] Stan: I think it’d fit cyberpunk better
[01/11/2025, 18:05:50] ceylan: yeah perhaps but both can apply
[01/11/2025, 18:06:36] ceylan: like dm allocates a player a card and bases the plot around those interacting aswell as ‘fates’, and players make characters based around the card and avoiding/achieving said ‘fate’
[01/11/2025, 18:07:45] ceylan: oh man this is such a cool concept i’m gonna have to plan a book around it and never write it
[01/11/2025, 18:08:39] Stan: It would be interesting, but what i feel like you’re building into is a one shot with much more spiritual inspiration
[01/11/2025, 18:08:48] Stan: Which in itself is cool
[01/11/2025, 18:09:10] Stan: But i think some other concepts could be applied aswell to increase the _*vibes*_
[01/11/2025, 18:09:43] ceylan: yeah that was my idea
[01/11/2025, 18:09:44] ceylan: just a one ahot
[01/11/2025, 18:09:46] ceylan: shot
[01/11/2025, 18:09:53] ceylan: here bro
[01/11/2025, 18:10:05] ceylan: like?🙏
[01/11/2025, 18:10:10] Stan: I’m not just talking about the tarot
[01/11/2025, 18:10:37] Stan: Could also include a much deeper plot involving moral alignments and how actions affect the soul as much as they affect the body
[01/11/2025, 18:10:57] Stan: A bit like the last one but much less superficial
[01/11/2025, 18:11:14] ceylan: right right i get yoj
[01/11/2025, 18:11:21] Stan: As in our fates being based on actual actions rather than what ben finds funny ‎<This message was edited>
[01/11/2025, 18:12:16] ceylan: so maybe in the first session out of two your actions decide your fate card and then like the next one is receiving the card and avoiding or achieving the fate
[01/11/2025, 18:12:54] Stan: The tarot does so much more than just determine a fate tho
[01/11/2025, 18:13:06] ceylan: doesn’t determine fate, only predicts
[01/11/2025, 18:13:21] Stan: It does more then that too
[01/11/2025, 18:13:27] Stan: It warns and encourages
[01/11/2025, 18:13:32] Stan: It makes shady things clear
[01/11/2025, 18:13:35] ceylan: ya
[01/11/2025, 18:13:53] ceylan: i think it would be super cool to just have a tarot card reader appear in the main campaign every now and again
[01/11/2025, 18:13:56] ceylan: like how we see
[01/11/2025, 18:13:58] ceylan: the weapon due
[01/11/2025, 18:13:59] ceylan: dude
[01/11/2025, 18:14:02] ceylan: fuck what’s his name
[01/11/2025, 18:14:04] ceylan: the gay one
[01/11/2025, 18:14:07] Stan: The deck of fates is the dnd equivalent tho
[01/11/2025, 18:14:14] ceylan: but instead of weapons we get our cards read n shit
[01/11/2025, 18:14:23] ceylan: then i want this then
[01/11/2025, 18:14:24] Dakota: Oscars boyfriend?
[01/11/2025, 18:14:28] ceylan: yeah
[01/11/2025, 18:14:36] Stan: We have had it tho
[01/11/2025, 18:14:41] ceylan: wizard guy
[01/11/2025, 18:14:41] Dakota: We had that, that’s how you got your wings
[01/11/2025, 18:14:44] ceylan: did we ?
[01/11/2025, 18:14:44] Stan: It got taken away by aegis
[01/11/2025, 18:14:51] Stan: The deck of many fates
[01/11/2025, 18:14:52] ceylan: oh that’s not what i’m talking about then
[01/11/2025, 18:14:56] ceylan: then gives or takes things
[01/11/2025, 18:14:57] Stan: Leo carried for a while
[01/11/2025, 18:15:04] ceylan: i was talk in about merely predicting
[01/11/2025, 18:15:05] Stan: Fate is give or take
[01/11/2025, 18:15:07] ceylan: talking *
[01/11/2025, 18:15:21] Dakota: The bones?
[01/11/2025, 18:15:32] Stan: I’m not sure how a dm would do that or how it would further the story in any way
[01/11/2025, 18:21:48] William Stothard: I mean if your looking for a fate system in dnd
[01/11/2025, 18:22:30] William Stothard: Grim hollow offers a way for the party to manipulate fate towards good/ away from a certain outcome
[01/11/2025, 18:22:41] William Stothard: Hold on lemme
‎[01/11/2025, 18:23:08] William Stothard: ‎image omitted
[01/11/2025, 18:23:31] William Stothard: That chapter of the book will probably help build the idea a little
[01/11/2025, 18:24:08] William Stothard: Allowing the dm to interact more with "fate" in a way thats balanced between players and dm
[01/11/2025, 18:24:17] William Stothard: Instead of dm just having absolute say
[01/11/2025, 18:26:20] ceylan: just roleplaying a tarot card dealer, having them pull specific cards to clue for the plot it’s not gotta be something mechanical
[01/11/2025, 18:26:24] ceylan: overthinking man
[01/11/2025, 18:26:28] ceylan: just roleplay 😭😭
[01/11/2025, 18:26:53] Stan: Ben doesn’t do anything except for the plot
[01/11/2025, 18:27:03] William Stothard: Duh thats why one of us does it
[01/11/2025, 18:27:08] ceylan: my issue bro
[01/11/2025, 18:27:11] ceylan: that’s the point 😭
[01/11/2025, 18:27:14] Stan: Also how many of our *characters* would believe in it?
[01/11/2025, 18:27:20] William Stothard: Bro its fate
[01/11/2025, 18:27:24] William Stothard: Literally everyone
[01/11/2025, 18:27:28] Stan: Lucius sure don’t
[01/11/2025, 18:27:31] ceylan: the sister may keep it in mind but she wouldn’t believe
[01/11/2025, 18:27:36] William Stothard: Well he gay asf then
[01/11/2025, 18:27:50] Stan: And what if they were?
[01/11/2025, 18:28:01] William Stothard: Then that's completely acceptable
[01/11/2025, 18:28:07] Stan: Good
[01/11/2025, 18:28:12] Stan: Inclusion in dnd ong
[01/11/2025, 18:28:15] Dakota: Zinbella would probably allow it to happen, may take mild interest, but no major ties
[01/11/2025, 18:28:17] William Stothard: I mean no disrespect to homosexuals
[01/11/2025, 18:28:23] Stan: We have a gay man in our party
[01/11/2025, 18:28:25] Stan: *had
[01/11/2025, 18:28:31] William Stothard: I mean absolute disrespect to lucius

[01/11/2025, 18:28:57] Stan: We gotta tell him
[01/11/2025, 18:29:00] ceylan: the sister canonically had a rebel phase in her early 200s guys n she certainly was slightly promiscuous in that time
[01/11/2025, 18:29:06] ceylan: men AND women

[01/11/2025, 18:29:40] William Stothard: I doubt it
[01/11/2025, 18:29:47] ceylan: ask ben to have it fall on the grass or smth 🥀

[01/11/2025, 18:32:24] Dakota: He’d be seen through, but he may appreciate the gesture
[01/11/2025, 18:32:32] William Stothard: Fuck
[01/11/2025, 18:32:34] Stan: Also asking him to would be metagaming
[01/11/2025, 18:32:48] Dakota: But you could decide
[01/11/2025, 18:32:56] William Stothard: Finneee 🙄
[01/11/2025, 18:33:04] William Stothard: Zymbella?
[01/11/2025, 18:33:21] William Stothard: William parrotblade?
[01/11/2025, 18:33:31] Stan: Would lucius, the regimented and no nonsense operative intentionally decide to demean himself for free shit
[01/11/2025, 18:33:39] William Stothard: Yes
[01/11/2025, 18:33:48] William Stothard: 100%
[01/11/2025, 18:33:50] Dakota: Depends on the quality of shit
[01/11/2025, 18:34:04] Dakota: Of bringing comfort to those that have lost
[01/11/2025, 18:34:13] Dakota: Or*
[01/11/2025, 18:34:51] Stan: Its heavily imoral
[01/11/2025, 18:35:01] Stan: I can’t pretend to be albus forever
[01/11/2025, 18:35:36] William Stothard: Ughhh fine
[01/11/2025, 18:36:07] Stan: Also what if lucius’ personal preferences don’t align with albus’
[01/11/2025, 18:36:23] Stan: So whore yourself out
[01/11/2025, 18:36:28] William Stothard: Nah cant do
[01/11/2025, 18:36:37] William Stothard: Goes against tortle biology
[01/11/2025, 18:37:58] Stan: Well it can’t be me
[01/11/2025, 18:38:00] Stan: Zimbella tho
[01/11/2025, 18:38:18] William Stothard: Telling ya
[01/11/2025, 18:38:21] Stan: Or maybe we shouldn’t try and hook  up one of our party members with a recent widow
[01/11/2025, 18:38:23] William Stothard: William parrotbalde
[01/11/2025, 18:38:26] William Stothard: Blade*
[01/11/2025, 18:39:16] Stan: Morals guys
[01/11/2025, 18:39:17] Stan: Morals
[01/11/2025, 18:39:23] Stan: Y’all are meant to be heroes
[01/11/2025, 18:39:40] Dakota: Maybe, but also I’m half intending to get rid of him semi soon
[01/11/2025, 18:39:56] Dakota: Not suicidal, just don’t bring him back if it happens
[01/11/2025, 18:40:02] Dakota: What are those
[01/11/2025, 18:40:42] Stan: Something we’re all meant to have
[01/11/2025, 18:52:54] William Stothard: What are morales, if not a cage of the mind, a machination of society meant to restrain those of true ambition and will ‎<This message was edited>
[01/11/2025, 18:53:06] William Stothard: Sarcasm btw
[01/11/2025, 18:54:00] Stan: What is truth but a survivor’s story
[01/11/2025, 18:55:47] ceylan: not really tbh
[01/11/2025, 18:55:48] William Stothard: Wisdom is a curse, an understanding of all that surrounds you, born of the pain of past mistakes
[01/11/2025, 18:56:03] ceylan: we got dragged into heroness but we are all just protecting to alleviate themselves of their curse
[01/11/2025, 18:56:10] ceylan: what
[01/11/2025, 18:56:24] ceylan: i don’t know what i’m trying to say there
[01/11/2025, 18:56:31] William Stothard: Neither
[01/11/2025, 18:56:47] William Stothard: Something about our heroism being a veil for our freedom i think
[01/11/2025, 18:56:50] ceylan: attempting
[01/11/2025, 18:56:53] ceylan: that’s what i meant to say
[01/11/2025, 18:56:56] ceylan: instead of protecting
[01/11/2025, 18:57:02] William Stothard: Got ya
[01/11/2025, 18:57:07] ceylan: but yea
[01/11/2025, 18:57:12] ceylan: none of us strive to be heroes
[01/11/2025, 18:57:20] ceylan: it just so happens that as a result of our goals we have done heroic things
[01/11/2025, 18:57:29] William Stothard: Maybe some do, maybe some are misguided
[01/11/2025, 18:57:43] ceylan: who’s heroic in the group cmon
[01/11/2025, 18:58:02] William Stothard: You make a fabulous point
[01/11/2025, 18:58:24] ceylan: i’ve been reading though the mythic odyssey of theros book and it’s lowkey awesome
[01/11/2025, 18:58:24] William Stothard: Tbf honu is renowned in his home region for his acts of heroism
[01/11/2025, 18:58:36] ceylan: blud has not mentioned it ever sadly
[01/11/2025, 18:58:41] William Stothard: Ooh whats that about?
[01/11/2025, 18:58:44] William Stothard: Never asked
[01/11/2025, 18:58:49] William Stothard: Never find out
[01/11/2025, 18:58:53] ceylan: it’s lowkey ancient greece in dnd
[01/11/2025, 18:59:00] William Stothard: Sick
[01/11/2025, 18:59:09] William Stothard: ZEEUUUUSSSSS
[01/11/2025, 18:59:13] ceylan: YURPPP
‎[01/11/2025, 19:00:14] William Stothard: ‎image omitted
[01/11/2025, 19:00:28] ceylan: is this real…
[01/11/2025, 19:01:01] Stan: Lucius is anything but a hero
[01/11/2025, 19:01:08] Stan: More like an unwilling participant
[01/11/2025, 19:01:23] ceylan: real
[01/11/2025, 19:01:32] ceylan: so many times the sister has complained abt wasting time on god
[01/11/2025, 19:05:42] Stan: Idk why we specifically have to do all this
[01/11/2025, 19:05:54] William Stothard: Whats wromg with a little whimsy
[01/11/2025, 19:05:55] Stan: Our allies have made it clear they have stronger men than us
[01/11/2025, 19:06:11] William Stothard: Were cheap?
[01/11/2025, 19:06:19] William Stothard: Thats the thing you see
[01/11/2025, 19:06:36] ceylan: the fact she’s more likely to turn into a tree the longer she faffs around
[01/11/2025, 19:06:39] William Stothard: Its easy to buy someone who's never tasted wealth
[01/11/2025, 19:06:40] Stan: What are they paying for??
[01/11/2025, 19:06:42] William Stothard: Ah
[01/11/2025, 19:07:27] William Stothard: I do feel like the curses are a bit lackluster/unequal
[01/11/2025, 19:07:32] ceylan: real
[01/11/2025, 19:07:43] ceylan: like albus fell into shit if he fell and i’m turning  into a fuckass tree
[01/11/2025, 19:08:01] Stan: I DIE if i touch a bird
[01/11/2025, 19:08:02] William Stothard: Like youve got a noticeable but dealable curse that can have real story implications
[01/11/2025, 19:08:07] ceylan: LMAOOO
[01/11/2025, 19:08:08] William Stothard: Youd never know that
[01/11/2025, 19:08:14] William Stothard: It would just happen
[01/11/2025, 19:08:19] Stan: If we have to ride a griffon anywear i’m cooked
[01/11/2025, 19:08:28] Stan: We all know our curses
[01/11/2025, 19:08:35] William Stothard: But like my curse isnt even a curse
[01/11/2025, 19:08:35] Stan: Technically i think i become downed
[01/11/2025, 19:08:43] William Stothard: Ahh
[01/11/2025, 19:08:54] Stan: So i’d like to imagine after enough seizures lucius got the gist of it ‎<This message was edited>
[01/11/2025, 19:08:59] William Stothard: Incapacitated
[01/11/2025, 19:09:09] William Stothard: Ok that makes more sense
[01/11/2025, 19:09:22] ceylan: bro had to get rid of pet birds real fast type shi
[01/11/2025, 19:09:34] William Stothard: But also jack, leo, me havent really got a serious curse
[01/11/2025, 19:09:42] ceylan: so basically you have a bird allergy and i got a fucking death curse
[01/11/2025, 19:09:47] Stan: You best belive he never took well to falconry
[01/11/2025, 19:09:56] William Stothard: But that's cool tho
[01/11/2025, 19:10:01] William Stothard: Its drives your character
[01/11/2025, 19:10:07] William Stothard: Creates story
[01/11/2025, 19:10:09] ceylan: she already had a drive😭😭😭
[01/11/2025, 19:10:20] William Stothard: I heard you liked drive
[01/11/2025, 19:10:27] William Stothard: So i added more drive to your drive

‎[01/11/2025, 19:10:51] Stan: ‎sticker omitted
[01/11/2025, 19:10:55] William Stothard: It doesn't thats my point
[01/11/2025, 19:11:09] William Stothard: Alot pf us are not compelled to interact with the curse thing
[01/11/2025, 19:11:23] William Stothard: Because it has no real consequences for our characters
[01/11/2025, 19:11:52] Stan: It doesn’t really tie us together as much as ben would want
[01/11/2025, 19:11:57] William Stothard: Yeah
[01/11/2025, 19:12:06] William Stothard: Thoughts on asking for a curse mulligan?
[01/11/2025, 19:12:16] ceylan: i feel like it’s become a forgotten aspect of the plot
[01/11/2025, 19:12:21] William Stothard: So we all get an equal level of curse
[01/11/2025, 19:12:23] ceylan: like it no longer matters that we’re cursed
[01/11/2025, 19:12:29] William Stothard: That actually affects us as characters
[01/11/2025, 19:12:33] Stan: We haven’t done anything towards it
[01/11/2025, 19:12:39] William Stothard: Exactly
[01/11/2025, 19:12:48] Stan: It would be better if we all had the *same* curse imo ‎<This message was edited>
[01/11/2025, 19:13:02] William Stothard: Maybe
[01/11/2025, 19:13:14] William Stothard: I think the uniqueness is fine
[01/11/2025, 19:13:30] William Stothard: But also timescale hello?
[01/11/2025, 19:13:52] William Stothard: How were we all cursed again?
[01/11/2025, 19:13:58] William Stothard: From childbirth yeah?
[01/11/2025, 19:14:06] Stan: Its not clear
[01/11/2025, 19:14:10] William Stothard: How tf does that work
[01/11/2025, 19:14:15] William Stothard: Well it should be
[01/11/2025, 19:14:28] Stan: We found a book that dictated the time and place we were cursed
[01/11/2025, 19:14:29] ceylan: no he told us
[01/11/2025, 19:14:35] Stan: But none of us remember apparently
[01/11/2025, 19:14:35] ceylan: we were all cursed at the same time
[01/11/2025, 19:14:36] Stan: Weird
[01/11/2025, 19:14:37] ceylan: ish
[01/11/2025, 19:14:42] William Stothard: Ohh ok then
[01/11/2025, 19:14:44] ceylan: she was experimenting with her powers at random
[01/11/2025, 19:14:48] Stan: But albus is 100s of years old
[01/11/2025, 19:14:49] William Stothard: That makes more sense
[01/11/2025, 19:14:52] Stan: Maybe 1000s
[01/11/2025, 19:14:55] William Stothard: As is the sister
[01/11/2025, 19:15:06] ceylan: although i don’t remember how the sister was introduced to the group
[01/11/2025, 19:15:13] Stan: So she just got clowned on in her 800s
[01/11/2025, 19:15:15] William Stothard: Tavern dwelling
[01/11/2025, 19:15:41] William Stothard: It wasn't much if i remember
[01/11/2025, 19:16:12] ceylan: the sister would NOT tavern dwell
[01/11/2025, 19:16:25] William Stothard: Apparently so
[01/11/2025, 19:16:44] Stan: Nor would we randomly feel the same aura and decide “yeah I’ll dedicate my foreseeable future to helping these guys”
[01/11/2025, 19:16:47] William Stothard: And honu wouldn't cower  and let his friends doe
[01/11/2025, 19:16:57] William Stothard: Die*
[01/11/2025, 19:17:02] William Stothard: Speak for yourself
[01/11/2025, 19:17:11] Stan: Lucius got assigned to y’all for apparently being useless
[01/11/2025, 19:17:15] Stan: Or sm like that
[01/11/2025, 19:17:27] William Stothard: Relateability ig?
[01/11/2025, 19:17:31] Stan: None of the introductions have been all that character appropriate
[01/11/2025, 19:17:42] William Stothard: Accept for albus
[01/11/2025, 19:17:45] William Stothard: Rip my man
[01/11/2025, 19:17:57] William Stothard: Died how he was introduced

[01/11/2025, 19:19:12] Stan: Its such a ben thing to do tho

[01/11/2025, 19:30:46] Leo: Right could someone give me any important cliff notes for the last 450 something messages that happened while I was busy
[01/11/2025, 19:33:04] Leo: Is anyone planning anything
[01/11/2025, 19:34:55] Dakota: Weekly game nights at the Stothards, Friday nights, idea of group cooking for it

[04/11/2025, 00:30:15] ceylan: one demands i stay in college despite my misery and do a career that could make me miserable and the other demands i leave
[04/11/2025, 00:30:42] Dakota: What would leaving get you?
[04/11/2025, 00:31:14] ceylan: out of childcare and bitch class bro
[04/11/2025, 00:31:33] Dakota: So less cons, but any pros?
[04/11/2025, 00:32:32] River: What would you do other than childcare
[04/11/2025, 00:32:46] ceylan: no university
[04/11/2025, 00:32:46] Dakota: If leaving puts you in a place to get qualifications, all good, but finishing college at least gives you something to build from if not
[04/11/2025, 00:32:53] ceylan: which is something i cannot decide if im willing to accept
[04/11/2025, 00:33:05] ceylan: something admin like

[04/11/2025, 00:33:39] River: It's ok to change your mind fr
[04/11/2025, 00:35:09] ceylan: thank you my bro
[04/11/2025, 00:35:14] Dakota: If you think you can manage to survive long enough to finish, then majority of uni courses just need a college education, no specific course
[04/11/2025, 00:35:21] ceylan: yes yes
[04/11/2025, 00:35:30] Dakota: But that’s only if your committed to uni
[04/11/2025, 00:35:31] ceylan: but am i just wanting to do uni for the social life
[04/11/2025, 00:35:36] ceylan: which is what i think im looking for
[04/11/2025, 00:35:40] Dakota: If not, go for something else then
[04/11/2025, 00:35:47] ceylan: but i can just replicate this by going to clubs anyways
[04/11/2025, 00:36:26] Dakota: But I’ll tell you what makes things seem better
[04/11/2025, 00:36:34] Dakota: It’s late, go eep
[04/11/2025, 00:36:44] ceylan: u might be right
[04/11/2025, 00:38:31] Dakota: Eepy times, tell us if it’s better in the morning
[04/11/2025, 00:39:48] ceylan: shall do my bro
[04/11/2025, 07:00:31] William Stothard: Ig the decision boils down to this, if you leave now you'll have only your GCSE qualifications and your childcare WE for any job you apply to, limiting any further income and leaving you with very few options later in life, making it harder to rise to any position that could make you comfortable in life (happiness is subjective), so the short term benefits of dropping out are great. But if you can hold out for some 6 months you'll leave with a very good T level qualification. Which immediately makes you more employable in most jobs, as it shows you have the resilience and the brains to get through FE which surprisingly most don't. After FE you have a whole year to decide if you go to uni or if regular work is for you, or you could even apply to uni at a later date. Point im making is if you drop out now you'll limit yourself for the rest of your life and you'll have to put so much more effort into going further, if you hold out for the 6 months, you prove to any employer that you are more accomplished than others, you don't have to go to Uni immediately after, you can go at any time, but you can never redo FE. That's what i see anyhow, Though i would urge that if you are feeling unable to continue your FE, please talk to one of the college mental health folk, they are great at keeping you going through hard times. Idk what your going through, but ik we all believe you can do this ‎<This message was edited>
[04/11/2025, 07:00:41] William Stothard: Sorry thats a lot
[04/11/2025, 07:01:06] William Stothard: Ive had the talk on dropping out so many times now
[04/11/2025, 07:03:02] William Stothard: Ive turned into my fucking dad 🫩
[04/11/2025, 07:04:27] William Stothard: Tldr: short term pain now. Or long tem pain later
[04/11/2025, 07:10:15] William Stothard: Or rather: short term pain now=more money after you finish
[04/11/2025, 12:19:23] ceylan: thank you bro

[04/11/2025, 12:20:19] William Stothard: Completely fine
[04/11/2025, 12:21:07] Stan: At the end of the day a lot of employers ask for level three qualifications, never one in specific
[04/11/2025, 12:21:14] William Stothard: Exactly
[04/11/2025, 12:21:23] Stan: Its largely about proving resilience and commitment than actual knowledge
[04/11/2025, 12:21:48] William Stothard: Just having any makes you atleast more employable than 60% of the population
[04/11/2025, 12:22:07] Stan: Chat how the actual FUCK did i get a pimple on the bottom of my ear
[04/11/2025, 12:22:11] Stan: Tf is ts

[05/11/2025, 10:42:42] William Stothard: Stan 🫩 it would be considerably easier for her to understand less originally and understand more later

[06/11/2025, 15:30:17] Stan: Chat this is why i’d say cut the sides, the more foods you add the lower the chances of coming to a consensus

[06/11/2025, 15:31:01] Stan: LOCK IN
[06/11/2025, 15:31:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: Stir fry, cucumber side and brownies
[06/11/2025, 15:31:09] ceylan: also if me and dakota are making sides can we decide what (as long as everyone else fw it)

[06/11/2025, 15:32:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: Same

[06/11/2025, 15:32:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I think this falls into that 3/10
[06/11/2025, 15:32:46] ceylan: sometimes it just has a horrible aftertaste
[06/11/2025, 15:32:57] William Stothard: This shouldn't taste too much like cucumber
[06/11/2025, 15:33:02] William Stothard: Hence the use of spices
[06/11/2025, 15:33:14] Stan: Can we PLEASE just look for solutions over just saying what we do and don’t like over and over

[11/11/2025, 22:22:20] ceylan: why do they do this
[11/11/2025, 22:22:30] Stan: *_MONEY*_
[11/11/2025, 22:22:35] William Stothard: Rules and lore updates quote unquote
[11/11/2025, 22:22:42] Stan: But also cus rules need updating
[11/11/2025, 22:22:44] William Stothard: But yeah money
[11/11/2025, 22:22:50] Stan: The ridiculous cost however is kinda insane
[11/11/2025, 22:22:58] William Stothard: They are UK based tho
[11/11/2025, 22:23:11] William Stothard: So economic leakage isnt happening thankfully
[11/11/2025, 22:23:15] ceylan: but why?
[11/11/2025, 22:23:21] Stan: Balancing
[11/11/2025, 22:23:22] William Stothard: Cyz shits unbalanced
[11/11/2025, 22:23:26] Stan: Maintaining interest
[11/11/2025, 22:23:28] William Stothard: The other space elves
[11/11/2025, 22:23:32] William Stothard: Eldar
[11/11/2025, 22:23:33] ceylan: then make it balance in the first place i don’t get it
[11/11/2025, 22:23:35] William Stothard: Are unbalanced asf
[11/11/2025, 22:23:39] William Stothard: STILL
[11/11/2025, 22:23:45] Stan: Also because making new editions is fun
[11/11/2025, 22:23:46] William Stothard: Cuz its not that simple
[11/11/2025, 22:23:57] William Stothard: The game is hella big
[11/11/2025, 22:23:58] Stan: Why don’t we still play the first edition of dnd?
[11/11/2025, 22:24:04] ceylan: no ixea
[11/11/2025, 22:24:11] Stan: Exactly
[11/11/2025, 22:24:13] William Stothard: Balancing every interaction eith every rule takes forever
[11/11/2025, 22:24:27] Stan: New editions were made to keep the game fresh and retain interest from the fanbase
[11/11/2025, 22:24:28] William Stothard: Better to just rebalance later than wait a long ass time
[11/11/2025, 22:24:37] William Stothard: GW is a small company as well
[11/11/2025, 22:24:42] ceylan: right
[11/11/2025, 22:24:54] Stan: Also because many of the balancing decisions can only be made with lessons learned from official tournaments
[11/11/2025, 22:25:01] William Stothard: Yeah
[11/11/2025, 22:25:07] Stan: You don’t know how rules will interact when you write them
[11/11/2025, 22:25:14] William Stothard: Precisely
[11/11/2025, 22:25:28] William Stothard: There's hundreds of datasheets to write
[11/11/2025, 22:25:28] Stan: But its mainly - balance, interest and money
[11/11/2025, 22:25:36] William Stothard: Money is a big factor
[11/11/2025, 22:25:49] William Stothard: A model making company has gotta make its dues
[11/11/2025, 22:25:52] Stan: But the good news is that until you get a codex in a new edition, your rules are 100% free
[11/11/2025, 22:25:58] William Stothard: Yurp
[11/11/2025, 22:26:10] William Stothard: But sadly all codexes have released
[11/11/2025, 22:26:20] Stan: Only took 2 years
[11/11/2025, 22:26:22] William Stothard: So no luck for free drukhari fules
[11/11/2025, 22:26:39] William Stothard: But its 30 squid
[11/11/2025, 22:26:40] Stan: Well you can still get them, they just aren’t to date
[11/11/2025, 22:26:47] William Stothard: No you cant
[11/11/2025, 22:26:57] William Stothard: There are 0 free datasheets
[11/11/2025, 22:26:58] Stan: Not on the app

[11/11/2025, 22:28:31] Stan: Most of the rules

[11/11/2025, 22:32:16] Stan: Albeit lacking anything
[11/11/2025, 22:32:46] Stan: I’ll have 1200 points by the end of the year
[11/11/2025, 22:32:56] Stan: Then i’ll build out my meta list after that

[11/11/2025, 22:33:57] Stan: You only have access to the rules of one
[11/11/2025, 22:34:02] Stan: But on the app it displays them all
[11/11/2025, 22:34:03] ceylan: would you pick one ordinarily
[11/11/2025, 22:34:07] ceylan: how does it affect gameplay
[11/11/2025, 22:34:10] William Stothard: Its the like the subclass lf an army
[11/11/2025, 22:34:13] William Stothard: Of*
[11/11/2025, 22:34:18] Dakota: From what I understand, it’s like only having one subclass
[11/11/2025, 22:34:27] William Stothard: Yes
[11/11/2025, 22:34:52] Stan: It affects your army rules and stratagems
[11/11/2025, 22:34:56] William Stothard: Its basically special rules that typically favour a specific playstyl of fighting
[11/11/2025, 22:34:57] Stan: *detachment rules
[11/11/2025, 22:35:12] William Stothard: Mine allows me to do fast hit and run tactics

[12/11/2025, 11:11:04] Dakota: Blind kareoke is your mates pick a song, they put the kareoke version on, and you have to sing without seeing what song it is
[12/11/2025, 11:11:15] William Stothard: Sounds horrible
[12/11/2025, 11:11:31] Stan: Lose the beat and crush a beer?

[12/11/2025, 11:11:52] William Stothard: It has to be a song the person knows

[12/11/2025, 20:47:15] ceylan: HEHEHE
[12/11/2025, 20:47:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: I just spent like 2 hours scrolling through alohaii’s discord
[12/11/2025, 20:47:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz I found he keeps like unreleased songs and stuff on there
[12/11/2025, 20:47:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I found some of the peakest shit I’ve ever heard in my life
[12/11/2025, 20:47:58] Dakota: Congrats
[12/11/2025, 20:48:01] ceylan: so what’s this supposed to mean bitch🙁
‎[12/11/2025, 20:48:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: semi-auto honesty v3.wav ‎document omitted
[12/11/2025, 20:48:34] William Stothard: Utter peak
[12/11/2025, 20:48:34] River: likes it but not cool enough to say it
[12/11/2025, 20:48:44] ceylan: he gotta be nonchalant
[12/11/2025, 20:48:49] ceylan: eyyyy
[12/11/2025, 20:49:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: Now I just need to transfer them to my laptop so I can transfer them back to my phone so I can add them to spotify
[12/11/2025, 20:49:19] William Stothard: Bosh
[12/11/2025, 20:49:22] ceylan: yurp
[12/11/2025, 20:49:23] William Stothard: UNITED
[12/11/2025, 20:49:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: And on my laptop I can add artists and cover art so it looks like it was actually released even if it wasnt
[12/11/2025, 20:49:51] Stan: Means i personally wouldn’t get it but feel like it matches your personality and style
‎[12/11/2025, 23:21:32] William Stothard: ‎image omitted
[12/11/2025, 23:21:41] William Stothard: Im wheezing 😭
[12/11/2025, 23:28:11] Dakota: Oh god
[13/11/2025, 01:09:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: Gaaaaang
[13/11/2025, 01:10:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m having a fucking aneurysm
[13/11/2025, 01:10:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: So remember how I said I was trawling through alohaiis unreleased songs
[13/11/2025, 01:10:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: They are all stored as .wav files
[13/11/2025, 01:11:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: That is as lossless as it gets
[13/11/2025, 01:11:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I wanted those on spotify
[13/11/2025, 01:11:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: Problem: Spotify mobile can’t understand .wav files
[13/11/2025, 01:11:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: But
[13/11/2025, 01:11:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: It can understand .m4a files
[13/11/2025, 01:12:44] Oscar Hunt Brown: These are not typically lossless but Apple did something cool for once and made them lossless with their alac encoding
[13/11/2025, 01:13:03] Oscar Hunt Brown: So I can have lossless local audio on Spotify yippee
[13/11/2025, 01:13:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: Next problem
[13/11/2025, 01:13:36] Oscar Hunt Brown: I want cover art and other things so it isn’t just a placeholder image whenever I’m listening to it
[13/11/2025, 01:14:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: So after installing a program specifically to convert my .wavs into .m4a (alac) and figuring out what bit depth each song had
[13/11/2025, 01:14:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: I pulled all the .m4as into mp3tag to I can edit their metadata
[13/11/2025, 01:15:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: This means I can specify what the song’s title is, who made it, when it was made and a few other things including cover art
[13/11/2025, 01:16:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: I then spent like 30 mins gathering suitable images for the cover art because these songs were never released/finished and so don’t have any
[13/11/2025, 01:17:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: After this I loaded the songs onto my phone to check everything was working
[13/11/2025, 01:17:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: The songs that didn’t exist were still there
[13/11/2025, 01:17:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: So I deleted my iTunes library and added back only the songs from the folders that contain the songs
[13/11/2025, 01:18:06] Oscar Hunt Brown: I then loaded the songs from that
[13/11/2025, 01:18:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: Success
[13/11/2025, 01:18:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: The library is correct now
[13/11/2025, 01:18:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: Next fucking problem: cover art isn’t appearing
[13/11/2025, 01:18:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: Why? None but god himself knows
[13/11/2025, 01:19:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: So I consulted chatgpt
[13/11/2025, 01:21:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: After much deliberation with it I discovered that the likely cause is that the fucking metadata attributes are in the fucking wrong order AND BECAUSE SPOTIFY MOBILE IS FUCKING GAY, IF THE IMAGE ISNT IN ONE SPECIFIC FUCKING POSITION OR TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL OR THE WRONG FUCKING COLOUR, IT WONT FUCKING LOAD IT
[13/11/2025, 01:21:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: So now I have to download another program to fix the order
[13/11/2025, 01:22:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: Problem: nobody will just give me an exe to install it from, I can either install another program to install it from terminal or I can figure out how the guy on GitHub wants me to install it
[13/11/2025, 01:23:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: Next problem: all the fucking files are .xz files, of which I have never fucking heard of before
[13/11/2025, 01:25:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: Next problem, all of the code is in some language or another that I vaguely recognise and am pretty sure requires me to install YET ANOTHER FUCKING PROGRAM SO MY FUCKING LAPTOP CAN FUCKING UNDERSTAND THE FUCKING CODE TO FUCKING REORDER THE FUCKING METADATA SO THAT FUCKING SPOTIFY CAN STOP BEING A BLIND LITTLE BITCH AND LOAD THE FUCKING IMAGE THAT HAS BEEN IN FRONT OF IT THE WHILE TIME
[13/11/2025, 01:26:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: at this point I decided that figuring any of this technical installation bullshit was too much for 1 in the morning and I’m going to deal with it tomorrow
[13/11/2025, 01:26:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: And promptly came over here to crash out
[13/11/2025, 01:27:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: Good night friends :D

[13/11/2025, 10:24:09] Leo: Though yea personally I don’t like mixing source books and taking bits and pieces from other worlds
[13/11/2025, 10:24:33] William Stothard: Like what
[13/11/2025, 10:24:47] Leo: It just makes it hard for players like us who want to go and read up about the world we’re in

‎[13/11/2025, 10:30:51] William Stothard: ‎image omitted
[13/11/2025, 10:30:54] Stan: Though it’s in similar ilk to eberron
[13/11/2025, 10:31:11] Stan: Except while eberron is a separate planet
[13/11/2025, 10:31:24] William Stothard: Besides tal'dorei is a normal place compared to whitestone
[13/11/2025, 10:31:29] Stan: Tal’dorei and wildemount are continents
[13/11/2025, 10:31:37] Leo: Ye
[13/11/2025, 10:32:09] William Stothard: Crazy how we went to tal dorei to go somwhere like a days trip from waterdedo 🫩
[13/11/2025, 10:32:14] Stan: Also ben never told us exactly where we were when we went to those places so it is likely we have visited those continents
[13/11/2025, 10:32:16] Leo: And I think if memory stands tal’dorei has a similar thing to the lords alliance
[13/11/2025, 10:32:17] William Stothard: Waterdeep*
[13/11/2025, 10:32:35] Stan: Yeah 🫩

[13/11/2025, 10:35:10] Stan: I feel like it’s a little more organised than we may have seen since we haven’t really asked for details
[13/11/2025, 10:35:16] Leo: That’s what I’m saying
[13/11/2025, 10:35:34] Leo: It probably is
[13/11/2025, 10:35:45] Leo: But we as of yet don’t know

[13/11/2025, 10:37:46] Stan: I’m gonna assume so since we started this campaign being told it’s faerûn
[13/11/2025, 10:37:51] Stan: Tho that was session 1
[13/11/2025, 10:37:57] Stan: Which a few people missed

[13/11/2025, 10:38:42] Stan: Established as faerûn
[13/11/2025, 10:39:00] Stan: The only difference was gods, but he seems to have gone back on that decision
[13/11/2025, 10:39:04] Leo: What was the second season and what commenced it
[13/11/2025, 10:39:15] William Stothard: What

[13/11/2025, 10:42:15] Stan: HUSQVARNA, trust in the north ‎<This message was edited>
[13/11/2025, 10:42:21] William Stothard: Is it ironic?
[13/11/2025, 10:42:30] William Stothard: Seems on purpose
[13/11/2025, 10:42:32] Dakota: You can be a rogue for myrkl now
[13/11/2025, 10:42:39] Leo: North is cold constantly
[13/11/2025, 10:42:59] Leo: Or more so that some other countries
[13/11/2025, 10:42:59] William Stothard: The region is called the north
[13/11/2025, 10:43:37] Dakota: And new wizard now has two blade singing subclasses
[13/11/2025, 10:43:57] William Stothard: Also fighter has got a sick subclass
[13/11/2025, 10:44:06] William Stothard: Team leader type shi
[13/11/2025, 10:45:00] Stan: Might use that for GH
[13/11/2025, 10:45:03] Stan: Seems fitting
[13/11/2025, 10:45:28] Dakota: The bard becomes a Druid, and the paladin becomes a genie warlock
[13/11/2025, 10:45:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: What’s the new one?
[13/11/2025, 10:45:49] Dakota: From what I’ve read, it’s pretty much the same
[13/11/2025, 10:45:55] Oscar Hunt Brown: Right
[13/11/2025, 10:45:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: But what is it?
[13/11/2025, 10:46:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: You’ve not answered the question Dakota
[13/11/2025, 10:46:22] Stan: It is literally called bladesinger
[13/11/2025, 10:46:30] Stan: Nearly identical
[13/11/2025, 10:46:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: Bladesinger was what the original Bladesinger was called
[13/11/2025, 10:46:55] Oscar Hunt Brown: So what is the new one then?
[13/11/2025, 10:47:00] Stan: No clue
[13/11/2025, 10:47:04] William Stothard: Chat bad news
[13/11/2025, 10:47:06] Dakota: Bladesinger
[13/11/2025, 10:47:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: I see
[13/11/2025, 10:47:19] William Stothard: The rogue subclass is literally our worst enemy
[13/11/2025, 10:47:22] Dakota: The original got changed to bladesinger legacy
[13/11/2025, 10:47:27] Stan: Literally
[13/11/2025, 10:47:40] William Stothard: "master of bane bhall and myrkul"
[13/11/2025, 10:47:49] Stan: I like the new ranger

[13/11/2025, 10:48:43] Stan: I think so
[13/11/2025, 10:48:45] William Stothard: Or will she remain cavalier
[13/11/2025, 10:48:48] William Stothard: Zamn
[13/11/2025, 10:48:54] William Stothard: No horse
[13/11/2025, 10:49:05] Stan: Probably easier for me to
[13/11/2025, 10:49:09] Stan: Less expensive
[13/11/2025, 10:50:24] Dakota: The paladin gets an elemental resistance that can be freely changed every turn costing not even a BA
[13/11/2025, 10:50:58] Dakota: From 7th
[13/11/2025, 10:52:16] Dakota: The sorcerer is kinda ass apart from 6th level having permanent counterspell
[13/11/2025, 10:52:30] Dakota: And regaining sorcery points for it
[13/11/2025, 12:51:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: For new Bladesinger there’s a new perk in bladesong that allows int to be used for attack and damage rolls
[13/11/2025, 18:18:27] Leo: Chat 2015 was 10 years ago
[13/11/2025, 18:19:23] Leo: Nearly 11

[15/11/2025, 14:26:03] ceylan: what do ou want out of a uni experience
[15/11/2025, 14:26:04] ceylan: uou
[15/11/2025, 14:26:28] ceylan: if you want a better social life pick a city, if you want better opportunity also a city, but if you want a better education then pick loughborough
[15/11/2025, 14:27:02] ceylan: with a course like yours you’ll be more hireable too if you go to a uni with better esteem and i believe loughborough is better out of the two but feel free to fact check me
[15/11/2025, 14:27:09] ceylan: it’s not like teaching where a job will automically land you a job
[15/11/2025, 14:27:15] ceylan: the quality of education matters with this one fr
[15/11/2025, 14:27:41] ceylan: make a pros and cons list on god it helped me a lot
[15/11/2025, 14:27:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: Birmingham is literally rated the best in the uk for ai
[15/11/2025, 14:27:55] Oscar Hunt Brown: And it’s really nice
[15/11/2025, 14:28:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: And the students seem much more enthusiastic

[15/11/2025, 14:28:34] ceylan: if it’s better reputation and you like the way it looks go for it
[15/11/2025, 14:28:42] ceylan: it’s really important that you kinda fall in love with the place
[15/11/2025, 14:28:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: And other things that I don’t remember
[15/11/2025, 14:28:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: And engineering

[15/11/2025, 14:29:02] ceylan: if you really love birmingham do it
[15/11/2025, 14:29:07] ceylan: it’s rare you’ll find a uni you love
[15/11/2025, 14:29:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: But Loughborough
[15/11/2025, 14:29:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: It has tonnes of things outside of degrees
[15/11/2025, 14:29:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: AND
[15/11/2025, 14:29:49] ceylan: hmm

[15/11/2025, 14:30:24] ceylan: yeah that’s sick
[15/11/2025, 14:30:33] ceylan: make a pros and cons list it will make things clearer
[15/11/2025, 14:30:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah will do when I get home
[15/11/2025, 14:35:35] Dakota: If it helps (or not) I’m heavily considering Loughborough for a sustainable engineering course
[15/11/2025, 14:35:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: That does not sway me one bit
[15/11/2025, 14:35:59] ceylan: we just got the new tech building too
[15/11/2025, 14:36:05] Oscar Hunt Brown: I mean no offence
[15/11/2025, 14:36:06] ceylan: by t level
[15/11/2025, 14:36:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: Whether you go to the same uni will not affect my decision
[15/11/2025, 14:36:47] ceylan: i swear loughbrough won some shit for having the best tech shit but i may be making that up
[15/11/2025, 14:36:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: No clue
[15/11/2025, 14:36:55] ceylan: rings a bell or smth
[15/11/2025, 14:37:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: The guy I talked to at Loughborough made it seem really good icl
[15/11/2025, 14:37:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: He was in his 2nd year in the course I want to do
[15/11/2025, 14:37:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: And like
[15/11/2025, 14:38:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: Idk
[15/11/2025, 14:38:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: Birmingham is like what you think of when you think uni
[15/11/2025, 14:38:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: But also, I’m already more qualified for the course I want to do than most of the people I talked to at Birmingham when they started
[15/11/2025, 14:39:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: I think it mostly is down to presentation
[15/11/2025, 14:39:33] Dakota: Fair
[15/11/2025, 14:39:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: Birmingham gave a better representation of what you do there
[15/11/2025, 14:39:36] ceylan: don’t be stressing abt it too much at the min bro you’ve got a year
[15/11/2025, 14:39:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s true

[17/11/2025, 22:08:55] ceylan: oh ya

[17/11/2025, 22:09:12] William Stothard: That's the one
‎[17/11/2025, 22:09:52] ceylan: ‎image omitted
[17/11/2025, 22:09:58] ceylan: this is the one
[17/11/2025, 22:10:27] ceylan: incase yall interested:
[17/11/2025, 22:10:31] ceylan: This panel written by Sui Ishida is an intelligent demonstration of foreshadowing and also maximises the impact of a a pivotal turning point  within the Tokyo Ghoul plot, exploring themes of doom, corruption and identity dissociation. 
Ishida expertly foreshadows terrifying Counter Commision of Ghouls (CCG)’s Reaper (Arima) future one-eyed glaucoma blindness later in the manga, whilst drawing on parallels between him and the protagonist Kaneki, further developing the mirrored and paternal relationship between the pair. 
By deliberately leaving a blind spot within the panel, which also could be simply be interpreted as an artistic choice to draw attention to and encourage the reader to focus on the opposing side, Ishida realised the one eyed blindness that Arima experiences due to the rapid aging as a result of the half-ghoul programme being ran in the Sunlit Garden (a programme in which Washuu bloodlines are being bred and turned into ghouls to create ‘super half ghouls ghouls’ to maintain the human ghoul balance, whilst incidentally starting the catalytic events of the one eyed king revolution). This is monumental, as Arima’s blindness is not confirmed verbally nor even hinted at verbally until it was confirmed in chapter 60 of the second half of the series. This creates a early warning of Arima’s weaknesses, hinting the reader of plot beyond the characters knowledge, positioning the reader in the view of the ‘omniscient reader’, therefore enhancing the doom which can be felt for Kaneki as he battles him as we as the reader can be aware of a way the invincible Reaper can be defeated, but Kaneki is not aware. Furthermore, it further develops the excitement and investment from the reader once Kaneki does finally realise his blind spot. 
Within this panel, Kaneki has sustained a devastating injury from Arima’s quinque in his left eye— one which would spell his imminent doom and descent into madness and creating a fission within Kaneki’s mind. After sustaining the injury to his left eye, Kaneki begins to spout nonsensical ravings along with deep rooted fears as he spirals into death, things like ‘give it back, it’s mine’, ‘why is there no one around’ along with ‘mackerel’ and ‘swordfish’. Kaneki’s descent into madness in this chapter also foreshadows the splitting of Kaneki’s identity further, forming the CCG puppet Haise Sasaki. 
His nonsensical ramblings can be seen before this finale panel, and this is the apex panel before Arima delivers the final blow, leaving the readers feeling utterly unhopeful for Kaneki pulling himself together to defend himself against the Reaper. 
Kaneki can be seen to damage Arima’s quinque ‘Ixa’, creating a sense of hope for Kaneki from the reader as he’s finally been able to get past the defences, but this is quickly dispelled, plunging the reader further into doom, when Kaneki is delivered the final blow.
Another pivotal moment in the panel is when Arima reveals that he does know exactly who ‘Eyepatch’ (the name allocated to the centipede ghoul by the CCG), which Arima says with a fond smile. 
The CCG had been suspecting for some time that Eyepatch was Ken Kaneki, a student who went missing after having surgery following an accident, and eventually went on to link him to the evil doctor Kanou and his ghoul experiments. They found out that he had been an engineered ghoul, which raised moral questions across the CCG, like ‘is he truly evil? is he human anymore? is it WRONG to kill him?’. Whilst this had an effect on many of the CCG investigators, the higher ups/ Washuu did not care for this, and only highlighted him as an enemy, further emphasising their corruption and immortality. 
Ishida’s decision to have Arima smiling here not only adds another layer of melancholy to the panel, but could potentially draw on parallels between the two, as well as foreshadow the future relationship built between the two.  Later in the story, Arima takes the mentor role for newly created Haise, and Haise himself claims that Arima feels like
his father. This is devastating, as Kaneki throughout the story has a detrimental impact on his own mental health due to the role of his parents (his biological one beat him, his adopted ones neglected him, and his found family father died) and the whilst the reader does not the full extent to the effect his family had on him at this point, we do know that any role of parent Kaneki takes on is detrimental and only  spells doom for him. This initial fondness Arima expresses for him, as well as choosing to non-lethally deal with Kaneki and take him as prisoner once he realises who he is, shows that a Arima does not want Kaneki to perish, despite clear orders to ‘let no ghoul pass alive’. It also adds an essence of empathy for Arima, as whilst his smile is fond, it is bittersweet, possibly indicating that Arima feels sad in ‘dealing with’ Kaneki, showing the prior doubt that several CCG feel in eradicating Kaneki due to his nature.   This goes strongly against The Reaper’s nature, as he’s known to be merciless, cruel and omnipotent, only further deepening this initial relationship and foreshadowing for their relationship later, in this panel. 
Furthermore, the intentional artistic and storytelling choice to have Arima deliver his initial devastating blow to Kaneki’s left eye, and to have the injury be just a black hole rather than a detailed wound, which is clearly an intential choice as Ishida has more than proved he’s capable of creating horrifying images, draws on parallels on Arima and Kaneki from their past and the future to come. 
As mentioned, Arima was a engineered half ghoul, designed to be an opponent to maintain the balance of humans and ghouls, keeping the CCG on top, and Kaneki was a university student who had the ‘half-ghoulificaiton’ procedure performed on him without his consent or knowledge, turning him into arguably the strongest of his kind. 
The parallel in this panel of both of them having blind spots in their left eye connects them and implicitly highlights how they have similar destinations, these possibly being becoming a controlled weapon by the CCG, unconsentingly being turned into half ghouls, their place in the ghoul revolution, the themes of loneliness they both explore together, and most importantly their roles as the One-Eyed Kings. 
Throughout the narrative, a feared One-Eyed is said to emerge and reshape the world, and it is unclear who it is, or even if the person has come to exist yet. The search for this One-Eyed King (OEK) is driven by terrorist ghoul organisation Aogiri, one of the primary oppositional groups in the manga who are desperate to have Ghouls rule society. As part of their search, they encounter Kaneki naturally as part of their search as he is a ‘one eyed’, and progressively they take and take from Kaneki, leading him to pursue them in his act of blind revenge and descent into kakuja cannibalistic madness. Aogiri’s actions directly lead Kaneki to this fight, as their actions lead Kaneki to become on the CCG’s radar through his revenge against the cruel terrorised. It’s important to note that at this point, and until the very ending of the manga as a whole, Kaneki never once killed a human, so he should have never been a target for the CCG— only enhancing the corruption within the CCG, highlighting their unjustness, unfairness and speciesism. This is a theme thoroughly explored in the book through Amon and Kaneki. This only makes this finale fight between Kaneki and Arima feel all the more despairing, as Kaneki, whilst not being entirely innocent, has not broken any laws- he is just existing in the body he’s been cursed with. 
In the second half of the series— :re— Arima reveals during their final fight that he himself is the One-Eyed King, or atleast the placeholder for it. Him and Eto— the leader of enemy organisation Aogiri— had concocted this idea of the OEK in order to have one rise to the throne, and that Arima’s tolerance for Kaneki and mercy is because of his hope that he will rise to the throne amidst the chaos between the opposing species in society. Following this fight, Arima could have easily ended Kaneki’s life, but as circumstances developed, Kaneki lost his memories and gave Arima the perfect opportunity to ‘mentor’ and parent him in order to lead him to the throne. Whilst not being so straightforward, it does work, and Kaneki succeeds Arima as the one to reshape the world.
Whereas, the colour contrast between black and white could indicate the sheer difference in their outcomes, for example Arima perishes later in battle with Kaneki, over a hundred chapters  later, whereas Kaneki does not die in the manga, and Arima fails to complete his goal as the One-Eyed King, whereas Kaneki succeeds him and completes the goal. Additionally, Kaneki not only takes the role of OEK from Arima, but he also takes the title of Reaper. Throughout the manga, Arima is known as The CCG’s Reaper, or even the White Reaper, but when Kaneki regains his memories following the Haise arc, he becomes the Black Reaper, regaining his black hair colour in symbolism of the regaining of his person again. This happens whilst Arima is alive still, pitting the two against eachother through titles, but also directly linking the two in their opposing directions. In the initial emergence of the Black Reaper, he did not immediately oppose the CCG, he continued his job whilst biding his time and planning— an extra cruelly and ruthlessness in his actions— but most importantly stopped his contact with Arima. This directly shows the opposing directions they take once Kaneki re-emerges and creates their opposing similarity— both powerful and capable killers with motives, but now following different paths. 
This juxtaposing parallel and contrast in the panel foreshadows such a fate effectively, leaving readers feeling a sense of awe as they realise that all the hints they’ve been given amount to a pivotal point in the plot— and that this has been hinted throughout the entire plot. This only emphasises Ishida’s ability to create and foreshadow plot, an extremely intelligent tactic which only shows that Ishida knew exactly what he intended for the story from the start; all whilst leaving the reader on their toes.

[17/11/2025, 22:14:37] ceylan: This panel written by Sui Ishida is an intelligent demonstration of foreshadowing and also maximises the impact of a a pivotal turning point  within the Tokyo Ghoul plot, exploring themes of doom, corruption and identity dissociation. 
Ishida expertly foreshadows terrifying Counter Commision of Ghouls (CCG)’s Reaper (Arima) future one-eyed glaucoma blindness later in the manga, whilst drawing on parallels between him and the protagonist Kaneki, further developing the mirrored and paternal relationship between the pair. 
By deliberately leaving a blind spot within the panel, which also could be simply be interpreted as an artistic choice to draw attention to and encourage the reader to focus on the opposing side, Ishida realised the one eyed blindness that Arima experiences due to the rapid aging as a result of the half-ghoul programme being ran in the Sunlit Garden (a programme in which Washuu bloodlines are being bred and turned into ghouls to create ‘super half ghouls ghouls’ to maintain the human ghoul balance, whilst incidentally starting the catalytic events of the one eyed king revolution). This is monumental, as Arima’s blindness is not confirmed verbally nor even hinted at verbally until it was confirmed in chapter 60 of the second half of the series. This creates a early warning of Arima’s weaknesses, hinting the reader of plot beyond the characters knowledge, positioning the reader in the view of the ‘omniscient reader’, therefore enhancing the doom which can be felt for Kaneki as he battles him as we as the reader can be aware of a way the invincible Reaper can be defeated, but Kaneki is not aware. Furthermore, it further develops the excitement and investment from the reader once Kaneki does finally realise his blind spot. 
Within this panel, Kaneki has sustained a devastating injury from Arima’s quinque in his left eye— one which would spell his imminent doom and descent into madness and creating a fission within Kaneki’s mind. After sustaining the injury to his left eye, Kaneki begins to spout nonsensical ravings along with deep rooted fears as he spirals into death, things like ‘give it back, it’s mine’, ‘why is there no one around’ along with ‘mackerel’ and ‘swordfish’. Kaneki’s descent into madness in this chapter also foreshadows the splitting of Kaneki’s identity further, forming the CCG puppet Haise Sasaki. 
His nonsensical ramblings can be seen before this finale panel, and this is the apex panel before Arima delivers the final blow, leaving the readers feeling utterly unhopeful for Kaneki pulling himself together to defend himself against the Reaper. 
Kaneki can be seen to damage Arima’s quinque ‘Ixa’, creating a sense of hope for Kaneki from the reader as he’s finally been able to get past the defences, but this is quickly dispelled, plunging the reader further into doom, when Kaneki is delivered the final blow.
Another pivotal moment in the panel is when Arima reveals that he does know exactly who ‘Eyepatch’ (the name allocated to the centipede ghoul by the CCG), which Arima says with a fond smile. 
The CCG had been suspecting for some time that Eyepatch was Ken Kaneki, a student who went missing after having surgery following an accident, and eventually went on to link him to the evil doctor Kanou and his ghoul experiments. They found out that he had been an engineered ghoul, which raised moral questions across the CCG, like ‘is he truly evil? is he human anymore? is it WRONG to kill him?’. Whilst this had an effect on many of the CCG investigators, the higher ups/ Washuu did not care for this, and only highlighted him as an enemy, further emphasising their corruption and immortality. 
Ishida’s decision to have Arima smiling here not only adds another layer of melancholy to the panel, but could potentially draw on parallels between the two, as well as foreshadow the future relationship built between the two.  Later in the story, Arima takes the mentor role for newly created Haise, and Haise himself claims that Arima feels like
his father. This is devastating, as Kaneki throughout the story has a detrimental impact on his own mental health due to the role of his parents (his biological one beat him, his adopted ones neglected him, and his found family father died) and the whilst the reader does not the full extent to the effect his family had on him at this point, we do know that any role of parent Kaneki takes on is detrimental and only  spells doom for him. This initial fondness Arima expresses for him, as well as choosing to non-lethally deal with Kaneki and take him as prisoner once he realises who he is, shows that a Arima does not want Kaneki to perish, despite clear orders to ‘let no ghoul pass alive’. It also adds an essence of empathy for Arima, as whilst his smile is fond, it is bittersweet, possibly indicating that Arima feels sad in ‘dealing with’ Kaneki, showing the prior doubt that several CCG feel in eradicating Kaneki due to his nature.   This goes strongly against The Reaper’s nature, as he’s known to be merciless, cruel and omnipotent, only further deepening this initial relationship and foreshadowing for their relationship later, in this panel. 
Furthermore, the intentional artistic and storytelling choice to have Arima deliver his initial devastating blow to Kaneki’s left eye, and to have the injury be just a black hole rather than a detailed wound, which is clearly an intential choice as Ishida has more than proved he’s capable of creating horrifying images, draws on parallels on Arima and Kaneki from their past and the future to come. 
As mentioned, Arima was a engineered half ghoul, designed to be an opponent to maintain the balance of humans and ghouls, keeping the CCG on top, and Kaneki was a university student who had the ‘half-ghoulificaiton’ procedure performed on him without his consent or knowledge, turning him into arguably the strongest of his kind. 
The parallel in this panel of both of them having blind spots in their left eye connects them and implicitly highlights how they have similar destinations, these possibly being becoming a controlled weapon by the CCG, unconsentingly being turned into half ghouls, their place in the ghoul revolution, the themes of loneliness they both explore together, and most importantly their roles as the One-Eyed Kings. 
Throughout the narrative, a feared One-Eyed is said to emerge and reshape the world, and it is unclear who it is, or even if the person has come to exist yet. The search for this One-Eyed King (OEK) is driven by terrorist ghoul organisation Aogiri, one of the primary oppositional groups in the manga who are desperate to have Ghouls rule society. As part of their search, they encounter Kaneki naturally as part of their search as he is a ‘one eyed’, and progressively they take and take from Kaneki, leading him to pursue them in his act of blind revenge and descent into kakuja cannibalistic madness. Aogiri’s actions directly lead Kaneki to this fight, as their actions lead Kaneki to become on the CCG’s radar through his revenge against the cruel terrorised. It’s important to note that at this point, and until the very ending of the manga as a whole, Kaneki never once killed a human, so he should have never been a target for the CCG— only enhancing the corruption within the CCG, highlighting their unjustness, unfairness and speciesism. This is a theme thoroughly explored in the book through Amon and Kaneki. This only makes this finale fight between Kaneki and Arima feel all the more despairing, as Kaneki, whilst not being entirely innocent, has not broken any laws- he is just existing in the body he’s been cursed with. 
In the second half of the series— :re— Arima reveals during their final fight that he himself is the One-Eyed King, or atleast the placeholder for it. Him and Eto— the leader of enemy organisation Aogiri— had concocted this idea of the OEK in order to have one rise to the throne, and that Arima’s tolerance for Kaneki and mercy is because of his hope that he will rise to the throne amidst the chaos between the opposing species in society. Following this fight, Arima could have easily ended Kaneki’s life, but as circumstances developed, Kaneki lost his memories and gave Arima the perfect opportunity to ‘mentor’ and parent him in order to lead him to the throne. Whilst not being so straightforward, it does work, and Kaneki succeeds Arima as the one to reshape the world.
Whereas, the colour contrast between black and white could indicate the sheer difference in their outcomes, for example Arima perishes later in battle with Kaneki, over a hundred chapters  later, whereas Kaneki does not die in the manga, and Arima fails to complete his goal as the One-Eyed King, whereas Kaneki succeeds him and completes the goal. Additionally, Kaneki not only takes the role of OEK from Arima, but he also takes the title of Reaper. Throughout the manga, Arima is known as The CCG’s Reaper, or even the White Reaper, but when Kaneki regains his memories following the Haise arc, he becomes the Black Reaper, regaining his black hair colour in symbolism of the regaining of his person again. This happens whilst Arima is alive still, pitting the two against eachother through titles, but also directly linking the two in their opposing directions. In the initial emergence of the Black Reaper, he did not immediately oppose the CCG, he continued his job whilst biding his time and planning— an extra cruelly and ruthlessness in his actions— but most importantly stopped his contact with Arima. This directly shows the opposing directions they take once Kaneki re-emerges and creates their opposing similarity— both powerful and capable killers with motives, but now following different paths. 
This juxtaposing parallel and contrast in the panel foreshadows such a fate effectively, leaving readers feeling a sense of awe as they realise that all the hints they’ve been given amount to a pivotal point in the plot— and that this has been hinted throughout the entire plot. This only emphasises Ishida’s ability to create and foreshadow plot, an extremely intelligent tactic which only shows that Ishida knew exactly what he intended for the story from the start; all whilst leaving the reader on their toes.

[18/11/2025, 18:07:18] William Stothard: I refuse the question
[18/11/2025, 18:07:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: Do either
[18/11/2025, 18:07:44] Dakota: Do procedures, but not the history
[18/11/2025, 18:07:55] Stan: Interesting choice
[18/11/2025, 18:08:00] Stan: People usually go the other way
[18/11/2025, 18:12:32] Dakota: I hate history with a passion
[18/11/2025, 18:12:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: Unless it’s for a game
[18/11/2025, 18:12:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: Then it’s peak
[18/11/2025, 18:13:13] Dakota: I can deal with game history, I usually actually care about that enoigh for it to sink in

[18/11/2025, 18:27:49] William Stothard: One should never repeat history
[18/11/2025, 18:27:58] William Stothard: Good or bad
[18/11/2025, 18:28:11] Dakota: Fire was history? No more fire?

[20/11/2025, 19:05:15] William Stothard: Gods sake
[20/11/2025, 19:06:01] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s literally almost 2 canisters of compound
[20/11/2025, 19:06:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: What is this dlc
[20/11/2025, 19:06:24] William Stothard: One could say its
[20/11/2025, 19:06:27] William Stothard: *mega*
[20/11/2025, 19:06:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: One may
[20/11/2025, 19:36:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: Astroneer is officially fucked :(
[20/11/2025, 19:36:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: The update is a buggy mess
[20/11/2025, 19:36:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: And multiplayer crashes every half a second on the ps5 version
[20/11/2025, 19:37:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: And the host runs at 5 fps on the ps4 version
[20/11/2025, 19:37:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: And the import save function doesn’t work
[20/11/2025, 19:37:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: And the new large canisters have been balanced horrifically
[20/11/2025, 19:38:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: And the megatech stuff is absurdly expensive
[20/11/2025, 19:38:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: And you can’t access megatech at all in creative because missions are disabled
[20/11/2025, 19:38:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: Somehow this is worse than risk of rain’s 2nd dlc
[20/11/2025, 19:38:57] ceylan: :(
[20/11/2025, 19:39:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: I didn’t even know it could get worse
[20/11/2025, 19:39:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: But at least I can play my game in stunning 4k 60 fps now 😔

[21/11/2025, 07:05:51] ceylan: not sure if this classifies as a nightmare
[21/11/2025, 07:06:09] ceylan: but the turantula previously to eating my toes was running across my face
[21/11/2025, 07:06:24] ceylan: i do not have a phobia of these things mind you so idk why my brain cooked this up

[21/11/2025, 22:13:12] William Stothard: Which is to know thyself and thy enemy

[22/11/2025, 00:20:10] Leo: Guys ngl kinda feeling like I dont know if I have “best friends” the best way I have to describe it is I don’t have anyone who I have a connection with like Stan and Oscar no one who would be there for me no matter what ‎<This message was edited>
[22/11/2025, 00:20:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: I would be
[22/11/2025, 00:20:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: Without a shadow of a doubt
[22/11/2025, 00:20:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: I will be there for you
[22/11/2025, 00:20:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: If you have any issue
[22/11/2025, 00:20:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ever
[22/11/2025, 00:21:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: I will help to the best of my ability
[22/11/2025, 00:21:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: You will never be alone so long as I breathe
[22/11/2025, 00:21:51] Leo: And I know that but the bond you and Stan have is just different
[22/11/2025, 00:22:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: You’re different people
[22/11/2025, 00:22:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: With different interests
[22/11/2025, 00:22:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: And different personalities
[22/11/2025, 00:22:46] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I don’t talk to anyone as frequently as I do with you
[22/11/2025, 00:23:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: I know you better than I know my siblings
[22/11/2025, 00:23:27] Leo: For longer to
[22/11/2025, 00:23:44] Oscar Hunt Brown: Technically debatable
[22/11/2025, 00:23:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: Because I live with them
[22/11/2025, 00:23:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: But that’s not my point
[22/11/2025, 00:24:54] Leo: You have known me and have been semi regularly meeting with me since pre school
[22/11/2025, 00:25:03] Oscar Hunt Brown: I know
[22/11/2025, 00:27:58] Leo: The point is yes me and you have know each other for fucking forever and that gives us a bond but it’s very different to the one you and the rest of the group have
[22/11/2025, 00:28:26] Leo: True friend ship that is there not because of age
[22/11/2025, 00:28:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: I think we’ve discussed this before
[22/11/2025, 00:29:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: I see your point
[22/11/2025, 00:29:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I’m not really sure how to respond
[22/11/2025, 00:29:53] Leo: Because of love (in a friendship way)
[22/11/2025, 00:30:21] Oscar Hunt Brown: What do you mean? /srs ‎<This message was edited>
[22/11/2025, 00:31:58] Leo: You and everyone else act as if you have know the people around you for decades even if you have only known each other for a fraction of that time
[22/11/2025, 00:32:48] Leo: Meanwhile for me it actually takes those years if not decades to get that connection
[22/11/2025, 00:33:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: Honestly, it’s just finding likeminded people
[22/11/2025, 00:33:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: I just got really lucky
[22/11/2025, 00:33:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: Jasmines been going through a similar thing for the last 6 months
[22/11/2025, 00:34:08] Leo: And evidence would suggest I am less lucky
[22/11/2025, 00:34:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ve never had any problems relating to friends
[22/11/2025, 00:34:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: I would disagree
[22/11/2025, 00:34:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: I wouldn’t say you’re unlucky
[22/11/2025, 00:34:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: As I said, I just got really lucky
[22/11/2025, 00:34:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: I found the people that I love to be around very quickly
[22/11/2025, 00:35:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m sorry I can’t help with this, genuinely. I’ve never been in your position.
[22/11/2025, 00:35:40] Leo: Context: Don’t get me wrong I love all of you guys as friends it’s just that there is something that seems to happen between all of you and not me
[22/11/2025, 00:35:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: If you think there is a way, please tell me
[22/11/2025, 00:36:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: My priority, as always, is your (and everyone else in this group)’s happiness
[22/11/2025, 00:36:20] Leo: It’s a complicated issue
[22/11/2025, 00:36:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: If there is anything I can do
[22/11/2025, 00:37:53] Leo: I’m not saying I’m not happy in the group, what I’m saying is (and I will be honest here) I envy the ability to look at a person and just become friends
[22/11/2025, 00:38:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: I get that
[22/11/2025, 00:38:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: But it also wasn’t that simple
[22/11/2025, 00:38:28] Oscar Hunt Brown: For some people it is
[22/11/2025, 00:39:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: Me and Stan have always had similar interests
[22/11/2025, 00:39:39] Oscar Hunt Brown: Or so I say
[22/11/2025, 00:39:55] Oscar Hunt Brown: My first memories of talking to him were about warhammer
[22/11/2025, 00:40:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: He introduced me to it
[22/11/2025, 00:40:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: I met him through jack
[22/11/2025, 00:40:28] Oscar Hunt Brown: Who was *the* nerd at the time
[22/11/2025, 00:40:55] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I met him through will Donaghy, who I had been friends with since about year 3
[22/11/2025, 00:41:01] Oscar Hunt Brown: And am still friends with
[22/11/2025, 00:41:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: My dad always says, “it’s not about what you know, it’s about who you know”
[22/11/2025, 00:41:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I think that perfectly encapsulates the difference in situations here
[22/11/2025, 00:42:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: I guess?
[22/11/2025, 00:42:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: You’ve had to move schools several times because they shut down
[22/11/2025, 00:42:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: And lost many, if not all of the friends you made (please correct me if I’m wrong)
[22/11/2025, 00:42:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: That never happened to me
[22/11/2025, 00:43:12] Leo: Quick question how long did it take you and Stan to become friends
[22/11/2025, 00:43:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: I just made 2 or 3 friends in primary school that lead me to where I am now
[22/11/2025, 00:43:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s a good question
[22/11/2025, 00:43:44] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t think it was long
[22/11/2025, 00:44:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: Maybe a few weeks at nost
[22/11/2025, 00:44:21] Oscar Hunt Brown: But
[22/11/2025, 00:44:29] Leo: Not all but connections were massively strained
[22/11/2025, 00:44:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: We weren’t anywhere near as close as we are now
[22/11/2025, 00:44:50] Leo: How long on
[22/11/2025, 00:44:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: None of mine were
[22/11/2025, 00:44:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: Well, except one
[22/11/2025, 00:45:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I don’t think about him any more
[22/11/2025, 00:45:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: Wdym?
[22/11/2025, 00:45:51] Leo: How long did it take you to get to your current status of friendship with stan
[22/11/2025, 00:47:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: Its difficult to pick a single date, but I’d say probably that first night where we went out to sence valley
[22/11/2025, 00:47:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: So around 4 and a half years
[22/11/2025, 00:47:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s not to say we weren’t close before then
[22/11/2025, 00:47:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: We were
[22/11/2025, 00:47:42] Leo: Cuz I would like to note that at my school I have known kids for ~4 years and am only now beginning to become friends with some of them
[22/11/2025, 00:47:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: But it shifted my perspective somewhat
[22/11/2025, 00:48:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: I will stand by the fact that I’ve won the lottery in literally almost every way in my life
[22/11/2025, 00:49:05] Oscar Hunt Brown: Please, don’t compare yourself to me
[22/11/2025, 00:49:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: I mean that in the most sincere way possible
[22/11/2025, 00:49:20] Leo: I can’t stop winning type shit
[22/11/2025, 00:49:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: You get my point though
[22/11/2025, 00:49:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: The issues that most people face, I just haven’t
[22/11/2025, 00:49:50] Leo: I’m comparing myself to everybody around me
[22/11/2025, 00:49:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ve never had to work hard for anything
[22/11/2025, 00:50:26] Leo: At least you can recognise that fact
[22/11/2025, 00:50:35] Leo: Not many people can
[22/11/2025, 00:51:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: I just don’t know how I can help
[22/11/2025, 00:51:17] Leo: Who also seem to be able to make friends at the snap of their fingers
[22/11/2025, 00:51:34] Leo: By comparison to me
[22/11/2025, 00:51:52] Dakota: Nah not quite everyone
[22/11/2025, 00:52:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: So is it an autism thing?
[22/11/2025, 00:52:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: Joking
[22/11/2025, 00:52:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: Correlation, not causation
[22/11/2025, 00:52:49] Leo: For me it actually may be
[22/11/2025, 00:53:25] Leo: I don’t know why but over time people start to not like me the more they get to know me
[22/11/2025, 00:53:42] Dakota: Yeah I get that
[22/11/2025, 00:53:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: I did have that once
[22/11/2025, 00:54:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: He was my best friend through primary school
[22/11/2025, 00:54:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: But we drifted away in year 6 and stopped talking entirely after like half way through year 8
[22/11/2025, 00:55:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: I was the one holding the relationship up
[22/11/2025, 00:55:30] Leo: The best example I can think of is climbing. At first people found me funny and good to be around but six months later they found me annoying and a pest
[22/11/2025, 00:55:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: I stopped, and didn’t speak again until the start of this year where I messaged him about other people from Overseal that I found at ashby
[22/11/2025, 00:56:36] Oscar Hunt Brown: Well you’ve been around for more than 6 months, so I’d call that progress at the very least
[22/11/2025, 00:57:18] Leo: To be fair with you guys it’s not exactly been smooth sailing
[22/11/2025, 00:57:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: Depends on who you ask really
[22/11/2025, 00:57:55] Dakota: Yet the wind that threatens to blow the ship over also pushes it further towards its destination
[22/11/2025, 00:58:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’d say it has been, compared to jasmine for example
[22/11/2025, 00:58:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: That is a quote and half
[22/11/2025, 00:58:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: Where did you find that?
[22/11/2025, 00:58:45] Leo: Quote book
[22/11/2025, 00:59:06] Leo: I hope he made that up on the spot
[22/11/2025, 00:59:07] Dakota: Apparently I get wise when I’m overtired and trying to be helpful
[22/11/2025, 00:59:11] Dakota: I did
[22/11/2025, 00:59:15] Leo: Yes ‎<This message was edited>
[22/11/2025, 00:59:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: Same sometimes
[22/11/2025, 01:00:47] Leo: Tis true but still the storm is not  yet over, it has calmed but still ongoing
[22/11/2025, 01:01:22] Dakota: Then take what respite you can to prepare and gather your supplies and allies
[22/11/2025, 01:02:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: I got a question: is the storm just Leo’s shite mental health?
[22/11/2025, 01:03:05] Dakota: Perhaps
[22/11/2025, 01:03:13] Dakota: Alternatively, life in general
[22/11/2025, 01:03:17] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz he’s had rough time recently outside of us
[22/11/2025, 01:03:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: I know he doesn’t really interact outside of gatherings
[22/11/2025, 01:04:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: Either way this is outside of my expertise
[22/11/2025, 01:14:40] Leo: The storm represents the conditions of my social life in the group in other words unstable
[22/11/2025, 01:15:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: Personally I would disagree with that
[22/11/2025, 01:16:25] Oscar Hunt Brown: Because it wouldn’t make sense then for the winds to “push it further towards its destination”
[22/11/2025, 01:17:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: Which is a stable and positive social life
[22/11/2025, 01:17:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: I assume
[22/11/2025, 01:17:36] Oscar Hunt Brown: Now I’m gonna try and sleep
[22/11/2025, 01:17:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: I will talk tomorrow
[22/11/2025, 01:17:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: Good night broski
[22/11/2025, 01:18:30] Leo: The logical assumption is if you as a group experience something that I do that you don’t like you tell me and we work through it
‎[22/11/2025, 07:27:18] William Stothard: Is this made of your tears @⁨Stan⁩ ‎image omitted
[22/11/2025, 08:31:12] Stan: Yes.

[22/11/2025, 15:33:49] Leo: Lady’s and gentlemen and anything between I have just ran the numbers and my scrap storage for my astroneer world is fucking huge, 190 scrap is 6.4% of it
[22/11/2025, 15:44:47] Dakota: Oh god no one needs that much scrap
[22/11/2025, 16:52:57] William Stothard: How did it go chums?
[22/11/2025, 16:53:18] Stan: Zinbella is a hive mind now
[22/11/2025, 16:53:32] William Stothard: What
[22/11/2025, 16:53:45] Dakota: And we killed Skabatha
[22/11/2025, 16:53:52] William Stothard: Good
[22/11/2025, 16:53:55] William Stothard: Fuck her
[22/11/2025, 16:54:00] Dakota: We, not *we*
[22/11/2025, 16:54:03] Stan: Still in the feywild tho
[22/11/2025, 16:54:14] William Stothard: FUCK 😭
[22/11/2025, 16:54:25] William Stothard: Please tell me were going home soon?
[22/11/2025, 16:54:31] Stan: Soon
[22/11/2025, 16:54:35] Dakota: Ben says we should be out mid next session
[22/11/2025, 16:54:39] Stan: In the new year at latest
[22/11/2025, 16:54:43] Dakota: Oh
[22/11/2025, 16:55:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: Unfortunately I did basically get thrown into the feywilds
[22/11/2025, 16:55:15] William Stothard: Sad
[22/11/2025, 16:55:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[22/11/2025, 16:55:24] William Stothard: Just retcon it bro
[22/11/2025, 16:55:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: And basically nothing went well for me
[22/11/2025, 16:55:30] William Stothard: Ive never met you
[22/11/2025, 16:55:31] Stan: Oh and ceylan is a hoarder now
[22/11/2025, 16:55:35] Dakota: And we nearly got tpkd by some bread
[22/11/2025, 16:55:35] William Stothard: Therefore it didn't happen
[22/11/2025, 16:55:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: The situation did not make sense
[22/11/2025, 16:55:53] Stan: Also someone gave lucius firebombs for some reason
[22/11/2025, 16:56:03] William Stothard: Ok then
[22/11/2025, 16:56:50] Dakota: To deal with the near tpk from bread, I got forcibly changed an then just stood there and let them explode when they touched me
[22/11/2025, 16:57:05] William Stothard: Huh
[22/11/2025, 16:57:57] Dakota: Onyx turned me into a lightning hulk as the only one left standing, and one of their traits is that anyone that melees them takes 2d6 lightning damage

[24/11/2025, 21:55:29] ceylan: if it was was just me i’d probs get through like 1 bottle of shampoo per 2 weeks and 1 conditioner a week
[24/11/2025, 21:55:31] River: But I also have a condition that makes my skin extremely dry so I gotta have those extra steps

[02/12/2025, 22:21:33] William Stothard: Yup
[02/12/2025, 22:21:37] ceylan: transphobic btw
[02/12/2025, 22:21:45] Dakota: You see my issue
[02/12/2025, 22:21:51] Dakota: Is what I was afraid of
[02/12/2025, 22:22:03] Stan: Being lesbian for a trans man is transphobia
[02/12/2025, 22:22:22] Stan: Since to be a lesbian is to be a non male in a relationship with a female
[02/12/2025, 22:22:38] Dakota: I say in a lesbian way, but I also don’t feel female when I do
[02/12/2025, 22:22:48] Stan: So in a homosexual way
[02/12/2025, 22:22:53] William Stothard: Dakota bro id just leave it
[02/12/2025, 22:22:59] ceylan: haha right? right?
[02/12/2025, 22:23:08] Dakota: Yeah sorry I confuse myself
[02/12/2025, 22:23:20] Stan: If you are a male who is attracted to another male, that is homosexual
[02/12/2025, 22:23:27] Stan: In the rawest definition
[02/12/2025, 22:23:40] ceylan: it’s okay to be straight or in a straight relationship my dude
[02/12/2025, 22:23:53] ceylan: wait
[02/12/2025, 22:23:55] ceylan: other way around
[02/12/2025, 22:23:56] ceylan: GAY
[02/12/2025, 22:24:03] Stan: It’s ok to be gay
‎[02/12/2025, 22:24:11] ceylan: ‎sticker omitted
[02/12/2025, 22:24:19] Dakota: But I also don’t feel male?
[02/12/2025, 22:24:33] ceylan: hi guys terrible news of the day trans girls have been officially banned from girl guides
[02/12/2025, 22:24:42] Stan: Are you perchance, nonbinary?
[02/12/2025, 22:25:09] Stan: You a pansexual for sure
[02/12/2025, 22:25:12] Dakota: My personal gender seems to tak a backseat, but something about the way I feel is almost lesbian but not from a female, or towards a female
[02/12/2025, 22:25:22] ceylan: hmm
[02/12/2025, 22:25:23] ceylan: so
[02/12/2025, 22:25:26] Dakota: Dang, the guy with surname Potts is pan
[02/12/2025, 22:25:27] ceylan: are you perchance trans ?
[02/12/2025, 22:25:39] ceylan: or do you wish to be in a sapphic relationship from a non binary perspective
[02/12/2025, 22:25:40] Dakota: Sometimes
[02/12/2025, 22:25:49] Stan: Well they say it’s not from a female perspective
[02/12/2025, 22:26:04] Stan: I’m guessing genderfluid
[02/12/2025, 22:26:10] ceylan: ohhhh the overuse of female here is hurting my heart so much💔💔
[02/12/2025, 22:26:15] Stan: Much more of a day to day thing than a definitive identity ‎<This message was edited>
[02/12/2025, 22:26:16] ceylan: my poor little feminist heart
[02/12/2025, 22:26:28] Dakota: If anything, demiboy
[02/12/2025, 22:26:55] Stan: Makes sense
[02/12/2025, 22:27:04] Dakota: So if I had to choose one, male, but most of the time it’s whatever most convenient (often to the bit)
[02/12/2025, 22:27:06] Stan: Alphabet mafia rise ong
[02/12/2025, 22:27:11] Dakota: Exactly
[02/12/2025, 22:27:23] Stan: Crash the cis-tem chooms
[02/12/2025, 22:27:28] Dakota: They can’t offend us if they don’t know what they’re offending
[02/12/2025, 22:28:04] Stan: In other news the US has successfully banned gay marriage in texas
[02/12/2025, 22:28:14] ceylan: bro???
[02/12/2025, 22:28:23] Dakota: Time to nuke Texas
[02/12/2025, 22:30:45] Stan: More specifically the texan government branch successfully repealed the bill which requires a state to allow gay marriage
[02/12/2025, 22:31:02] Stan: It’s not banned per-se but it is no longer a right
[02/12/2025, 22:33:12] William Stothard: Well this seems like a healthy convo
[02/12/2025, 22:33:21] William Stothard: Genuinely
[02/12/2025, 22:33:22] River: Everything bigger in texas
[02/12/2025, 22:33:37] William Stothard: Including homophobia
[02/12/2025, 22:33:44] River: Yup
[02/12/2025, 22:34:04] Dakota: But that also means the gays are bigger to fight them
[02/12/2025, 22:34:12] River: Guns

[02/12/2025, 22:35:07] River: I dont understand why people get offended by love
[02/12/2025, 22:35:12] William Stothard: Alongside encouragement to vote and improved education on these topics
[02/12/2025, 22:35:23] River: Literally nothings wrong with it, no ones getting hurt
[02/12/2025, 22:35:39] William Stothard: People's biology see it as wrong
[02/12/2025, 22:35:48] River: How
[02/12/2025, 22:35:53] William Stothard: But we as a species possess unbound intelligence
[02/12/2025, 22:36:02] Dakota: Depends how kinky you get, but even then it’s consensual
[02/12/2025, 22:36:07] William Stothard: Why are we still trapped in our animalistic tendencies
[02/12/2025, 22:36:28] River: Yk way back when humans didn't care what parts the other had
[02/12/2025, 22:37:04] River: Literally had giant orgys
[02/12/2025, 22:37:41] Dakota: And it’s not even like no animals are gay, many many species have documented committed gay couples around the world
[02/12/2025, 22:37:57] Stan: “That guy standing way over there identifies as a woman, he’s threatening our society and i’ll bet he’s gonna rape our real women too” - james gammon, convicted rapist
[02/12/2025, 22:38:17] River: Bruh
[02/12/2025, 22:38:31] River: The world is so fucked

[02/12/2025, 22:43:49] Stan: We gotta fight for our beliefs ong

[02/12/2025, 22:47:40] Dakota: Since I woke up I’ve been a little over half deaf and I have no idea why
[02/12/2025, 22:47:54] Dakota: It’s still going and I may have to live tomorrow with it
[02/12/2025, 22:48:04] ceylan: maybe ear infection my bro

[02/12/2025, 22:52:04] William Stothard: If we blow up parliament are we any different than terrorists?

[03/12/2025, 07:20:11] Stan: So I’m already fuming
[03/12/2025, 08:36:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: I think I’ve figured out how combining tensors can store contextual information
[03/12/2025, 08:37:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: You know how when you look at a window during the day and you can see some reflection but you can also see outside as well
[03/12/2025, 08:37:39] Oscar Hunt Brown: So you can see both
[03/12/2025, 08:37:44] Oscar Hunt Brown: Right
[03/12/2025, 08:37:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s kinda like that
[03/12/2025, 08:38:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: The light reflecting from both is combined and allows you to see the reflection and outside at the same time
[03/12/2025, 09:08:32] Dakota: Oooooh that's cool
[03/12/2025, 09:09:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz the way you add the context vector to the input data is literally by adding it as a matrix
[03/12/2025, 09:09:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: I figured this was the same thing
[03/12/2025, 09:09:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: If you split light into a 3d vector containing red green and blue values then the same concept can be applied
[03/12/2025, 09:09:59] Dakota: Yeah basically just a combination of two inputs
[03/12/2025, 09:10:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[03/12/2025, 09:10:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s hard to wrap your head around with ai
[03/12/2025, 09:10:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: But it’s easier to understand with light
[03/12/2025, 10:32:24] ceylan: doing the first aid course is bringing back my paramedic / doctor yearning

[03/12/2025, 21:00:43] William Stothard: But its better than being a net ig

[03/12/2025, 21:03:45] Stan: Cut contact entirely
[03/12/2025, 21:03:57] Stan: If she tryna talk to yiu ignore her
[03/12/2025, 21:04:10] Stan: After enough it becomes harassment
[03/12/2025, 21:04:17] Stan: Involve the cops if it continues
[03/12/2025, 21:04:25] William Stothard: Aight beg

[03/12/2025, 21:05:27] William Stothard: Who's got advice?
[03/12/2025, 21:05:44] Dakota: Now this I can do
[03/12/2025, 21:05:55] William Stothard: Gwan
[03/12/2025, 21:06:05] Dakota: Do you have friends to form a human shield with?
[03/12/2025, 21:06:16] William Stothard: Huh
[03/12/2025, 21:06:37] Dakota: Put your other friends between you and her
[03/12/2025, 21:06:49] Dakota: Physically separating you from her
[03/12/2025, 21:07:07] Stan: So here is what you do
[03/12/2025, 21:07:13] Dakota: If not, noise cancelling headphones and sat in a corner
[03/12/2025, 21:07:13] Stan: Don’t talk to her
[03/12/2025, 21:07:15] William Stothard: One at a time please
[03/12/2025, 21:07:22] William Stothard: Done
[03/12/2025, 21:07:26] Stan: Claim moral high ground since she walked away
[03/12/2025, 21:07:36] William Stothard: How?
[03/12/2025, 21:07:37] Stan: Remind her of that fact constantly if ignoring her doesn’t work
[03/12/2025, 21:08:04] Stan: Finally, sit away from her and make it difficult for her to “bump into you”
[03/12/2025, 21:08:10] William Stothard: That i can do
[03/12/2025, 21:08:19] Stan: If she gotta go out of her way to harass you then you can make it a case
[03/12/2025, 21:08:33] William Stothard: Yurp
[03/12/2025, 21:08:40] William Stothard: Next question
[03/12/2025, 21:08:51] William Stothard: How to not get guilt tripped
[03/12/2025, 21:09:02] William Stothard: Cuz this i need serious help w
[03/12/2025, 21:09:20] Stan: River says “don’t be a pusssaaay”
[03/12/2025, 21:09:25] Dakota: Trip her right back
[03/12/2025, 21:09:31] William Stothard: Helpful
[03/12/2025, 21:09:33] Stan: Put in nice terms you gotta ignore her
[03/12/2025, 21:09:49] Stan: Then you gotta remind yourself of why things are the way you are
[03/12/2025, 21:09:53] Stan: Remember the facts
[03/12/2025, 21:09:57] William Stothard: Yup
[03/12/2025, 21:10:01] Dakota: The bullies never expect to get bullied by the person they’re bullying, so it’s the most effective
[03/12/2025, 21:10:09] William Stothard: Huh
[03/12/2025, 21:10:14] Stan: Don’t trip her back
[03/12/2025, 21:10:18] Stan: Just don’t engage
[03/12/2025, 21:10:42] Stan: By being “the bad guy” you validate the vilification she is already doing in her head
[03/12/2025, 21:11:05] Stan: Idk what guilt tripping she can do
[03/12/2025, 21:11:20] Stan: Just be solid in your opinions and values
[03/12/2025, 21:11:24] Dakota: Whatever she does if you can’t ignore it, give back in equal measure (make sure she knows it’s only exactly what she’s done tho)
[03/12/2025, 21:11:34] Stan: No just don’t engage
[03/12/2025, 21:11:40] Stan: These people thrive of attention
[03/12/2025, 21:11:41] William Stothard: Act like i hurt her, that its my fault, that she cried over me
[03/12/2025, 21:11:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m pretty much always available to talk or play sumn
[03/12/2025, 21:12:09] Stan: By even giving her any recognition you are giving her the attention she wants from walking away
[03/12/2025, 21:12:24] Stan: And so what if you did
[03/12/2025, 21:12:33] Stan: She made this scenario in her head
[03/12/2025, 21:12:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: She did too
[03/12/2025, 21:12:37] Stan: It isn’t real
[03/12/2025, 21:12:39] William Stothard: Stan yk me
[03/12/2025, 21:12:45] William Stothard: Im fucking weak bro
[03/12/2025, 21:12:58] William Stothard: I feel too much
[03/12/2025, 21:13:12] Stan: You gotta disconnect from her
[03/12/2025, 21:13:17] Stan: She ain’t shit to you anymote
[03/12/2025, 21:13:22] William Stothard: Done and dusted
[03/12/2025, 21:13:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: My best advice would be try and ignore her or find an excuse to be somewhere that isn’t near her
[03/12/2025, 21:13:41] Stan: Her value to you was made null and void the second she said she was backing out
[03/12/2025, 21:13:53] William Stothard: Aye
[03/12/2025, 21:14:05] Stan: So nothing she says matters
[03/12/2025, 21:14:09] Stan: She is nobody to you
[03/12/2025, 21:14:16] William Stothard: Aw fuck
[03/12/2025, 21:14:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: Her words have no effect on your life bro
[03/12/2025, 21:14:30] William Stothard: Just realised how imma get guilt tripped
[03/12/2025, 21:14:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: Words only matter if you let them
[03/12/2025, 21:14:49] William Stothard: That's good advice
[03/12/2025, 21:15:01] William Stothard: How do you stop caring
[03/12/2025, 21:15:04] William Stothard: Like genuinely
[03/12/2025, 21:15:10] Stan: There is no formula
[03/12/2025, 21:15:13] Stan: You just stop
[03/12/2025, 21:15:19] Stan: You don’t give a fucking shit
[03/12/2025, 21:15:28] Stan: Cus she ain’t mean shit
[03/12/2025, 21:15:31] Stan: She has no value
[03/12/2025, 21:15:36] Stan: Doesn’t affect you
[03/12/2025, 21:15:41] Stan: Aint your problem
[03/12/2025, 21:15:41] Oscar Hunt Brown: The less you think about her, the less impact she has ‎<This message was edited>
[03/12/2025, 21:15:45] Stan: And she can fuck off
[03/12/2025, 21:16:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: Eventually you forget about her and all is good again
[03/12/2025, 21:16:21] William Stothard: I more meant like mind tactics/exercises you can do
[03/12/2025, 21:16:27] Stan: There aren’t any
[03/12/2025, 21:16:32] Stan: Not caring isn’t a science
[03/12/2025, 21:16:37] Stan: Its just something you do
[03/12/2025, 21:16:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: I guess remind yourself that she doesn’t have any control over you
[03/12/2025, 21:16:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: You are your own person
[03/12/2025, 21:17:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: This is also true
[03/12/2025, 21:17:51] Stan: As a professional UPS tosser
[03/12/2025, 21:18:03] Stan: You don’t gotta give a shit about anyone else
[03/12/2025, 21:18:10] Stan: All that matters is you and what you want
[03/12/2025, 21:18:18] Stan: Chaotic evil in this motherfucker
[03/12/2025, 21:18:29] Stan: Become ungovernable
[03/12/2025, 21:19:39] William Stothard: Bro why does this feel impossible

[04/12/2025, 16:49:24] William Stothard: Also fun fact for the day chat seeing colour is like your nervous system having spare hdmi slots
[04/12/2025, 16:49:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: Should be
[04/12/2025, 16:49:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ll let you know if I need anything
[04/12/2025, 16:49:47] William Stothard: Sick
[04/12/2025, 16:52:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: Elaborate please
[04/12/2025, 16:52:40] William Stothard: Your retinas contain "cone" and "rod" receptors
[04/12/2025, 16:52:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yep
[04/12/2025, 16:53:09] William Stothard: Both are connected to sensory neurones
[04/12/2025, 16:53:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yep
[04/12/2025, 16:53:35] William Stothard: But cones are connected 1 to 1 (directly)
[04/12/2025, 16:54:04] William Stothard: Rods are connected in groups of 3 alongside having a lower range of light wavelength absorption
[04/12/2025, 16:54:25] Oscar Hunt Brown: Right
[04/12/2025, 16:54:28] William Stothard: Cones are fewer across your retinas
[04/12/2025, 16:54:39] William Stothard: And only function in higher light sources
[04/12/2025, 16:54:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yep
[04/12/2025, 16:54:51] William Stothard: Hence why you have worse vision at night
[04/12/2025, 16:54:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yep
[04/12/2025, 16:55:12] William Stothard: As your lower wavelength rod cells are absorbing less light
[04/12/2025, 16:55:27] William Stothard: It just struck me as funny
[04/12/2025, 16:55:33] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m not seeing it
[04/12/2025, 16:55:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: Pun intended
[04/12/2025, 16:55:42] William Stothard: Now that i say it
[04/12/2025, 16:55:47] William Stothard: Ive lost myself
[04/12/2025, 16:55:55] William Stothard: But its still a fun fact
[04/12/2025, 16:56:05] William Stothard: If you wonder why yo night vision is shit
[04/12/2025, 16:56:09] William Stothard: That's why
[04/12/2025, 16:56:22] William Stothard: But that's also why blue eyes see more
[04/12/2025, 16:56:35] William Stothard: As they absorb a wider range of colour
[04/12/2025, 16:56:50] William Stothard: (technically green absorbs the most)
[04/12/2025, 16:57:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: I still don’t see the relationship between the difference in retinal cells and hdmi ports
[04/12/2025, 16:57:40] William Stothard: There connection on a diagram reminded mo of shit cable management
[04/12/2025, 16:58:01] Oscar Hunt Brown: That makes more sense
[04/12/2025, 16:58:06] William Stothard: Yurp
[04/12/2025, 16:58:15] William Stothard: Joke explained
[04/12/2025, 16:58:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: But where did the spare ports come from?
[04/12/2025, 16:58:20] William Stothard: Humour lost
[04/12/2025, 16:58:46] William Stothard: Evolution gave us more sensory neurones so that we could differentiate colour
[04/12/2025, 16:58:55] William Stothard: And use conce cells at all
[04/12/2025, 16:58:59] William Stothard: Cone*
[04/12/2025, 16:59:11] William Stothard: Hence spare hdmi ports
[04/12/2025, 16:59:28] Oscar Hunt Brown: I give up

[05/12/2025, 10:40:50] William Stothard: But like
[05/12/2025, 10:40:52] Stan: Because finding someone who does high quality digital art and isn’t into freak shi is incredibly difficult
[05/12/2025, 10:41:20] William Stothard: Rán is a regular ahh goddess with minimal description as a whole
[05/12/2025, 10:41:34] William Stothard: Why is there so much art of her that is so freaky
[05/12/2025, 10:41:57] Stan: Because sex sells and art isn’t very lucrative

[05/12/2025, 10:45:03] Stan: But?
[05/12/2025, 10:45:47] River: Gods and godesses dont necessarily wear clothes either tho
[05/12/2025, 10:46:00] River: Being naked isn't a sexual thing, it's simply been made into one
[05/12/2025, 10:46:14] William Stothard: Fair nuff
[05/12/2025, 10:46:23] William Stothard: Depends
[05/12/2025, 10:46:23] Stan: Tends to be in relation to them being representative of primal forces and clothing being a “human” invention
[05/12/2025, 10:46:41] William Stothard: But gods are representatives of humans
[05/12/2025, 10:46:54] River: It tends to be minimal or but a singular sheet of cloth and jewellery
[05/12/2025, 10:46:58] William Stothard: Antigods tend to be more natural forces
[05/12/2025, 10:47:20] Dakota: Antigods?
[05/12/2025, 10:47:32] William Stothard: The enemy of the gods
[05/12/2025, 10:47:36] Stan: Also gods from a purely pragmatic perspective (not necessarily the “correct” view) are human creations
[05/12/2025, 10:47:43] William Stothard: Not the bad guys
[05/12/2025, 10:47:51] William Stothard: Just the antithesis
[05/12/2025, 10:47:56] Stan: As such we interpret them in ways that please us

[05/12/2025, 10:49:50] Dakota: Yeah that’s not that freaky
[05/12/2025, 10:50:15] William Stothard: Ja now that ive got past the stuff that unsettles me a little yeah its mostly normal

[09/12/2025, 22:29:01] Dakota: Yep
[09/12/2025, 22:29:14] Dakota: At least two more eps waiting for dub release
[09/12/2025, 22:29:28] Oscar Hunt Brown: What episode is the dub at?
[09/12/2025, 22:29:41] Oscar Hunt Brown: I swear the dubbed episodes come out at the same time though?
[09/12/2025, 22:30:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: Never mind
[09/12/2025, 22:30:12] Dakota: 167 was the last dub
[09/12/2025, 22:30:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: The 2 newest episodes aren’t dubbed
[09/12/2025, 22:30:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: Dude
[09/12/2025, 22:30:28] Oscar Hunt Brown: You need to watch them subbed right now
[09/12/2025, 22:30:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: 169 is actually peak
[09/12/2025, 22:31:03] Dakota: From the title, is it la brava and gentle criminal?
[09/12/2025, 22:31:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: No
[09/12/2025, 22:31:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: They are mentioned at the start of the episode though
[09/12/2025, 22:31:31] Dakota: Ah
[09/12/2025, 22:31:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: They aren’t being arrested because they helped
[09/12/2025, 22:31:42] Dakota: Yippee
[09/12/2025, 22:31:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: Trust me dude
[09/12/2025, 22:32:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: Watch the sub
[09/12/2025, 22:32:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: I genuinely think those 2 episodes are some of my favourites in the entire show ‎<This message was edited>
[09/12/2025, 22:33:47] Dakota: I am not a fast enough reader to keep up w subtitles when there’s action
[09/12/2025, 22:34:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t mean to patronise you, but how
[09/12/2025, 22:34:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: That part eludes me
[09/12/2025, 22:34:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: How can you not read it fast enough?
[09/12/2025, 22:35:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: The subtitles are not that fast cuh
[09/12/2025, 22:36:01] Dakota: I see where your confusion comes from, especially with autism favouring written word over spoken, but I’d have to stop tracking the action to read, so I’d end up either constantly pausing or rewinding
[09/12/2025, 22:36:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: I guess it’s kinda like a skill then
[09/12/2025, 22:36:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz I exclusively watch subbed
[09/12/2025, 22:36:36] Oscar Hunt Brown: So I can just do both
[09/12/2025, 22:36:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: I remember it being a bit more difficult when I started watching anime
[09/12/2025, 22:37:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: And vowed never to watch a dub again
[09/12/2025, 22:37:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: The English voices genuinely disgust me
[09/12/2025, 22:37:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: It hurts my soul to watch it
[09/12/2025, 22:37:41] Oscar Hunt Brown: ESPECIALLY Mushoku tensei
[09/12/2025, 22:37:50] Dakota: There is one dub I urge you to watch, so much better than any sub
[09/12/2025, 22:37:58] Dakota: Ghost stories English dub
[09/12/2025, 22:38:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: That is the only one I agree with
[09/12/2025, 22:38:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: There is one exception to my vow
[09/12/2025, 22:38:29] Dakota: Good
[09/12/2025, 22:38:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: Every other anime though
[09/12/2025, 22:38:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: Sub is better
[09/12/2025, 22:38:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: Every time
[09/12/2025, 22:38:55] Oscar Hunt Brown: Just learn to read cuh ‎<This message was edited>

[09/12/2025, 22:39:41] Oscar Hunt Brown: Fair enough
[09/12/2025, 22:39:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I can’t focus with a show on in the background anyway ‎<This message was edited>

[09/12/2025, 22:44:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: And the intro
[09/12/2025, 22:45:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s another song I’ve been listening to for ages
[09/12/2025, 22:45:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING
[09/12/2025, 22:45:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s like every anime I watch uses exclusively songs I already know
[09/12/2025, 22:47:17] Dakota: Watch more anime till they run out of songs you know?
[09/12/2025, 22:47:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: Mayhaps
[09/12/2025, 22:47:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m gonna find this fuckass song

[09/12/2025, 22:49:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: Mayhaps
[09/12/2025, 22:50:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m pretty sure I had watched one or two episodes by then too

[11/12/2025, 08:08:09] River: But then I looked back at some fuckass sparx work
[11/12/2025, 09:58:35] Dakota: I have a hack to make it easier
[11/12/2025, 09:59:13] Dakota: Work backwards and you’ll get hardly any bookwork checks
[11/12/2025, 10:13:06] Dakota: Hey guys you know how your parents feel old and tell you they’re older than Google?

[11/12/2025, 15:23:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: Today was fucking shit
[11/12/2025, 15:23:39] William Stothard: Why?
[11/12/2025, 15:26:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ashby decided that period 5 we would be required to stay in our forms and participate in a quiz that involved watching a video that was far longer than it needed to be with horrifically mixed Christmas music and playing “traitors” which I had specifically informed my form tutor I was not interested in doing either. So I was just going to sit there and do my maths homework because that was more pleasurable to me. But no. He had a go at me every time I tried to do something that wasn’t either participating or sitting there in silence.
[11/12/2025, 15:26:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: It has genuinely ruined my day
[11/12/2025, 15:27:03] William Stothard: Uncool
[11/12/2025, 15:27:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: And it doesn’t help that I’m incapable of just saying no and justifying myself
[11/12/2025, 15:27:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: I would’ve happily taken a detention instead
[11/12/2025, 15:27:37] William Stothard: Well im sorry that's happened to you bro
[11/12/2025, 15:27:54] William Stothard: We could kill him if you would like?
[11/12/2025, 15:28:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: And also after my brother gets back from school, I’m also required to go somewhere that my mum has told me I probably won’t like, but she won’t tell me where.
[11/12/2025, 15:28:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: Preferably not
[11/12/2025, 15:28:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t hate him
[11/12/2025, 15:28:29] William Stothard: Okie then broseph
[11/12/2025, 15:28:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: I just have no respect for him any more

[11/12/2025, 17:33:04] Dakota: Yeah I ended up reaching a chat limit trying to regenerate it to reduce those, but like the most major one I plan to mention is the double 0 on the graph, with the rest of the scale inconsistent

[18/12/2025, 12:50:14] ceylan: very different to active persecution
[18/12/2025, 12:50:30] ceylan: again, very different to an active regime
[18/12/2025, 12:50:36] Stan: We do not yet have active persecution, but it is not far away
[18/12/2025, 12:50:38] ceylan: we are pre cooked which means things can still changed

[18/12/2025, 12:52:09] ceylan: and sign petitions
[18/12/2025, 12:52:32] Stan: While i admit we don’t have an actively oppressive regime *yet* we are still living on the edge of that downfall
[18/12/2025, 12:52:46] ceylan: yurp
[18/12/2025, 12:52:52] Stan: We’re being issued britcards, immigration is being cut

[18/12/2025, 12:53:12] ceylan: being gay is still punishable by death in too many countries
[18/12/2025, 12:53:47] Stan: It’s not looking too good here either on that front
[18/12/2025, 12:54:20] ceylan: honest i don’t think they’ll illegalise it but i think hate crime prevention/punishment will be reduced
[18/12/2025, 12:54:45] Stan: I’m not saying we’re unsaveable but there is going to have to be a massive flip in the thinking of younger generations

[18/12/2025, 12:55:41] ceylan: you would not believe how many gay people i’ve met who’ve had the courage to come out because they had a teacher who wS openly gay
[18/12/2025, 12:56:02] Stan: The problem is really that people our age lack foresight or a critical view of politics and are susceptible to whoever makes the funniest campaign speeches rather than actual political promises
[18/12/2025, 12:56:06] ceylan: definitely
[18/12/2025, 12:56:19] ceylan: too many people don’t get ‘involved in politics’ holy shit it’s ur future😭😭😭🙏🙏

[21/12/2025, 12:31:33] Oscar Hunt Brown: Nope
[21/12/2025, 12:31:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: Other than more alcohol = more fun
[21/12/2025, 12:32:01] ceylan: oh good god
[21/12/2025, 12:32:26] Dakota: Exactly, it was the drunkest I’ve been and some of the most fun without moving
[21/12/2025, 12:32:41] River: Drink water and don't run off
[21/12/2025, 12:32:50] River: Also drink doesn't mean the entire fucking thing
[21/12/2025, 12:33:08] Stan: Alright so guys i’m all in for some good fun but yesterday was not responsible drinking, i have been informed that if we do that again we will *not* be allowed to do this again
[21/12/2025, 12:33:22] Stan: Pace yourselves
[21/12/2025, 12:33:22] Dakota: Yeah good point, it ran out way too fast
[21/12/2025, 12:33:41] Dakota: Oh dang we better slow down
[21/12/2025, 12:34:51] Stan: You’re all drinking to find limits and that’s not acceptable i’m afraid, a few members of the group and my family were made deeply uncomfortable by all of you
[21/12/2025, 12:35:01] Stan: I’m sorry to say this but this is what i have been told
[21/12/2025, 12:35:36] Dakota: Nah that fair it is your residence you (and will) should be the ones setting rules and limits
[21/12/2025, 12:36:02] River: Nah actually
[21/12/2025, 12:36:04] Stan: It’s not me or my brother
[21/12/2025, 12:36:07] River: The adults should
[21/12/2025, 12:36:07] Stan: It’s my parents
[21/12/2025, 12:36:12] River: As in Alison and Rob
[21/12/2025, 12:36:16] River: It's their house fr
[21/12/2025, 12:36:41] Dakota: Yeah but they can’t communicate that directly unless we’re there, so Stan and Will must act as representatives
[21/12/2025, 12:36:45] William Stothard: Actually stan ive been informed were never having drinking again
[21/12/2025, 12:36:58] ceylan: generally speaking i set a little rule if im gonna get wasted and its drink only after eating and after about 8/9pm cos otherwise youre gonna die
[21/12/2025, 12:37:00] ceylan: early
[21/12/2025, 12:37:06] Stan: I was told different but i understand
[21/12/2025, 12:37:06] ceylan: damn yall fucked up hella
[21/12/2025, 12:37:32] William Stothard: We're all to blame here
[21/12/2025, 12:37:37] Dakota: Oh dang we must have fucked up
[21/12/2025, 12:37:53] William Stothard: All attendees are responsible here
[21/12/2025, 12:37:58] ceylan: not sure that’s true icl
[21/12/2025, 12:38:05] Stan: Damn what did i do?
[21/12/2025, 12:38:07] ceylan: i think me stan and river were very responsible
[21/12/2025, 12:38:12] William Stothard: That's not my parents opinion
[21/12/2025, 12:38:17] ceylan: and it was the rest of yall being drunk idiots 💔
[21/12/2025, 12:38:23] Stan: What did i do?
[21/12/2025, 12:38:29] William Stothard: Idk bro
[21/12/2025, 12:38:39] William Stothard: Thats what ive been told
[21/12/2025, 12:38:57] Dakota: I’ll admit me and Oscar were very drunk, but I thought we were doing well staying in one place relatively quiet
[21/12/2025, 12:39:03] James: What abt me
[21/12/2025, 12:39:09] ceylan: respectfully im gonna have to disagree it was the 3 very drunken people that were probably at fault
[21/12/2025, 12:39:11] ceylan: yea mb
[21/12/2025, 12:39:14] River: James was very responsible
[21/12/2025, 12:39:23] ceylan: it’s not fair to blame all attendees and alleviate the blame from those who were actually responsible
[21/12/2025, 12:39:42] River: And he came to a function to the first time and it ended up like this 😭

[28/12/2025, 23:34:00] Dakota: Is that on the sides of your nose?
[28/12/2025, 23:34:03] River: Yurr
[28/12/2025, 23:34:25] Dakota: Ooooh go for it, if it’s not great you can always let them heal back up
[28/12/2025, 23:34:32] River: ‎River pinned a message
[28/12/2025, 23:34:43] River: I've had one before but I might redo it 😝
[30/12/2025, 15:13:45] ceylan: so real
[30/12/2025, 17:44:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: So
[30/12/2025, 17:44:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: Gang
[30/12/2025, 17:44:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: You know my ai I was working on
[30/12/2025, 17:44:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: The stakes are a bit higher now
[30/12/2025, 17:44:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m now also working on a new type of ai
[30/12/2025, 17:45:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: Because generative ai is basically just a really good predictive text engine
[30/12/2025, 17:45:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: And it can’t really handle logical thought
[30/12/2025, 17:45:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: So
[30/12/2025, 17:46:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: I came up with a new way
[30/12/2025, 17:47:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: The idea is that instead of using tens of billions or even trillions of numbers to make matrices to predict things
[30/12/2025, 17:48:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: I make a network of “nodes” that cover and connect different objects and events
[30/12/2025, 17:48:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: I can then build a string of thought that shows how a conclusion was reached
[30/12/2025, 17:49:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: I can reference the possible actions and all the information for each item in the text input
[30/12/2025, 17:50:01] Oscar Hunt Brown: And all of this works with a fraction of the computing power needed for modern language models like Gemini and chatgpt
[30/12/2025, 17:53:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: Because while this can produce a text output, it’s both modular and learns over time
[30/12/2025, 17:53:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: It also can be multimodal in terms of inputs
[30/12/2025, 17:54:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: But then I end up going back to the colossal matrices needed for advanced computer vision and audio recognition
[30/12/2025, 17:54:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: But those are problems for later
[30/12/2025, 17:55:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: The priority is a functional and efficient text engine that can handle logical reasoning and can justify its point
[30/12/2025, 18:14:33] Dakota: Ooooh fun
[30/12/2025, 18:29:06] ceylan: hell yeah
[30/12/2025, 18:29:41] River: I will come back to read that in a moment 😛

[05/01/2026, 07:14:44] William Stothard: Im bored so here's a riddle:
I roar yet have no mouth, I crack yet have no bones. I appear when things are torn, and rarely do I conform.
What am I?
[05/01/2026, 07:14:56] William Stothard: No clue if its any good
[05/01/2026, 07:15:03] River: I can't read
[05/01/2026, 07:15:12] River: Conform
[05/01/2026, 07:15:14] River: Religion
[05/01/2026, 07:15:28] River: Crack but ain't got no bones
[05/01/2026, 07:15:33] River: God to Mary
[05/01/2026, 07:15:39] River: 😨
[05/01/2026, 07:18:21] River: Nah but genuinely the roar I'm assuming it's not like a tiger and more of a wind kinda roar or smth like that, crack could be something to do with the earth, idk about the torn bit, assuming it's not to do with fabric and to link it to the earth and wind bit I'm assuming a storm?
[05/01/2026, 07:22:06] ceylan: i’m also thinking something natural
[05/01/2026, 07:22:13] ceylan: like ice or smth
[05/01/2026, 07:22:27] ceylan: but what’s that got to do with torn?
[05/01/2026, 07:22:31] ceylan: maybe it’s a hole guys idk
[05/01/2026, 07:50:07] River: WAIT
[05/01/2026, 07:50:11] River: iS IT THUNDER
[05/01/2026, 07:51:11] River: bc it roars and cracks and it's make sense on why I thought of storm 😛
[05/01/2026, 07:51:26] River: Please say I'm right, I beg I ain't got a riddle right in ages 🙏
[05/01/2026, 07:51:32] ceylan: i was lightning before the thunder
[05/01/2026, 07:51:44] River: THUNDA
‎[05/01/2026, 07:51:48] River: ‎sticker omitted
[05/01/2026, 07:52:03] ceylan: at first i thought it was like sewing or like thread or smth but that doesn’t roar sadly
[05/01/2026, 07:52:15] River: Sewing machine...
[05/01/2026, 07:52:35] River: They roar but not the others
[05/01/2026, 07:53:35] River: I thought of the wind because of the roar and I was stumped on the crack and I thought of an earthquake or something like that
[05/01/2026, 09:43:01] William Stothard: It is lightning congratulations

[05/01/2026, 09:50:55] William Stothard: To explain the torn part, 
Static as a concept is when 2 areas become polar (opposite) therefore when they are opposite they are against each other hence when things are torn
[05/01/2026, 12:15:20] ceylan: thought static was electrons ?
[05/01/2026, 12:15:28] ceylan: when one side became negatively charged and one positively charged
[05/01/2026, 12:15:31] ceylan: wait a fucking minute
[05/01/2026, 12:15:36] ceylan: that’s opposites
[05/01/2026, 12:15:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: Transfer of electrons yes
[05/01/2026, 12:15:50] ceylan: grade 7 physics btw

[05/01/2026, 12:21:09] ceylan: it is -5 degrees outside and 0 degrees INSIDE because they haven’t installed a heating and all the babies are blue and crying and i can’t feel my toes at all someone save me

[08/01/2026, 20:41:56] ceylan: shits been crickets bro
[08/01/2026, 20:41:58] ceylan: good!
[08/01/2026, 20:42:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I do need to revise for a maths assessment in a weeks time
[08/01/2026, 20:42:37] Dakota: Oh shi yeah I got maths to do too
[08/01/2026, 20:42:39] Oscar Hunt Brown: I was reorganising my bag and realised how much I’ve actually learned over the last few months
[08/01/2026, 20:42:47] Dakota: It’s fine it’s due to next week
[08/01/2026, 20:42:51] Dakota: Yippee
[08/01/2026, 20:42:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yuh
[08/01/2026, 20:42:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: Gimme a sec
[08/01/2026, 20:43:30] Dakota: I’m glad everyone else has been enjoying having a life, from how little people have been on since like Christmas

[08/01/2026, 20:45:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: I think I remember most of it
[08/01/2026, 20:45:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I’m gonna revise it anyway
[08/01/2026, 20:45:21] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz further maths is hard as fuck
[08/01/2026, 20:45:36] Oscar Hunt Brown: And complex numbers is by far the hardest topic we’ve done so far
[08/01/2026, 20:47:22] Dakota: I’m so glad further maths is optional for my lot
[08/01/2026, 20:48:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: Considering it requires at least an 8 in maths, I’d guess so
[08/01/2026, 20:49:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: I think my 2 favourite topics are calculus and algebraic methods
[08/01/2026, 20:49:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: Today I learned how to calculate the roots and the inverse of any quadratic or cubic equation
[08/01/2026, 20:50:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: Next week I’m gonna do quartics
[08/01/2026, 20:50:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: I hope the snow continues all night so I can escape physics tomorrow
[08/01/2026, 20:51:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: I should figure out what I do and don’t know in physics
[08/01/2026, 20:51:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz I’ve not really been taking notes
[08/01/2026, 20:51:25] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ll talk to Gemini
[08/01/2026, 20:55:14] Dakota: The snow continuing is great, but Loughborough won’t tell us if they’re closed till roughly 6:30 so we’ve still got to be up anyway
[08/01/2026, 20:55:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t usually get up until at least 7:30
[08/01/2026, 20:55:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’d probably get an email before or around then
[08/01/2026, 20:55:59] Dakota: Unfortunately that’s when our bus leaves Coalville
[08/01/2026, 20:56:03] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ah
[08/01/2026, 20:56:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s unfortunate
[08/01/2026, 20:56:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: Anyone up for Overwatch?

[12/01/2026, 18:03:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: Rather than producing shitty images, I’m just using it to adapt an existing one to a different format
[12/01/2026, 18:03:37] ceylan: yea slightly better tbf
[12/01/2026, 18:03:53] ceylan: the cover art looks sick tho fr

[14/01/2026, 09:54:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: Important discovery chat
[14/01/2026, 09:54:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: The 1x32GB ram prices are not only surprisingly stable, but also priced similar to 1x16 and even some 1x8 kits
[14/01/2026, 09:55:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: The 1x32s have been weirdly unaffected by ramageddon
[14/01/2026, 09:56:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: The 1x32 kit I’m gonna get is at least £100 cheaper than its 2x16 counterpart and has stayed at this price for the last few days
[14/01/2026, 09:56:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: Which is better than I can say for the 2x16s
[14/01/2026, 09:57:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: So far the 1x8s and the 2x16s seem to have been hit the hardest
[14/01/2026, 09:57:36] Oscar Hunt Brown: 1x16 is pretty bad
[14/01/2026, 09:57:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: And 1x32 is the best of all of them
[14/01/2026, 09:58:05] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ll come up with equivalent value later
[14/01/2026, 09:58:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: But 32gigs in 4x8 would be more expensive than 2x16 which is also more expensive than 1x32
[14/01/2026, 10:02:31] Dakota: That makes no sense, yet all the sense
[14/01/2026, 10:02:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[14/01/2026, 10:02:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: So I’ve managed to save £100 on ram
[14/01/2026, 10:03:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: Although with a performance hit since motherboards are designed to work with 2 sticks
[14/01/2026, 10:03:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: So 1 isn’t as fast as the motherboard can handle
[14/01/2026, 10:03:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: But this gives me the flexibility to upgrade to 64 gigs later
[14/01/2026, 10:04:09] Dakota: Yippee
[14/01/2026, 15:46:17] ceylan: anyone getting on the 3:50?

[14/01/2026, 19:14:22] Jack Payne: Basically 
Mrs Fox left at the start of this year. And with her went all of my brother’s considerations
[14/01/2026, 19:14:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: She actually did something besides being a twat?!?
[14/01/2026, 19:15:24] Jack Payne: My mom emailed about this after going in for a talk to get the consideration put back in place 
It’s been 5 weeks since then and still nothing
[14/01/2026, 19:15:44] Oscar Hunt Brown: Sounds about right
[14/01/2026, 19:15:46] Jack Payne: Well she was a pastoral lead and she was very much a don’t take shit from anyone person
[14/01/2026, 19:16:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: She was a pastoral lead?!?
[14/01/2026, 19:16:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: How the fuck did that happen?
[14/01/2026, 19:16:13] Jack Payne: Last year for year 7
[14/01/2026, 19:16:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ah
[14/01/2026, 19:17:29] Jack Payne: But now
My mom is going to get documentation for the considerations my brother had at the junior school from the junior school. 
And if shit doesn’t start happening, she’s gonna start steam rolling up the chain of command until something does
[14/01/2026, 19:17:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: I see
[14/01/2026, 19:17:49] Dakota: Good plan

[22/01/2026, 12:45:04] ceylan: yuppp
[22/01/2026, 12:45:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: If we use your argument for a “few” then if you don’t buy the most recent iPhone by Christmas, you may as well wait until the next one
[22/01/2026, 12:45:46] Dakota: Exactly
[22/01/2026, 12:45:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: that makes no sense
[22/01/2026, 12:45:59] Oscar Hunt Brown: Just get the phone and don’t worry about it
[22/01/2026, 12:46:08] Dakota: Plus the newest one isn’t usually great
[22/01/2026, 12:46:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: Generational differences are marginal
[22/01/2026, 12:46:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: It doesn’t matter which, they’re both insane compared to a 13
[22/01/2026, 12:47:11] Dakota: But also, camera design hasn’t been great for a while
[22/01/2026, 12:47:21] Oscar Hunt Brown: What do you mean?
[22/01/2026, 12:47:21] Dakota: The specs might be wonderful, but the design isn’t
[22/01/2026, 12:47:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: I much prefer the 11-16 pro design to the 17 pro
[22/01/2026, 12:48:06] Oscar Hunt Brown: Although there are many advantages to the larger unit
[22/01/2026, 12:48:21] ceylan: whic is better camera quality whilst still being pretty similar to 13
[22/01/2026, 12:48:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: It doesn’t matter though, cuz ceylan isn’t getting a pro
[22/01/2026, 12:48:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[22/01/2026, 12:48:44] ceylan: wym
[22/01/2026, 12:48:47] ceylan: i may
[22/01/2026, 12:48:49] ceylan: cos i like a big phone
[22/01/2026, 12:48:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: The only difference between it and mine is that mine can do 5x and raw photos
[22/01/2026, 12:48:59] ceylan: right
[22/01/2026, 12:49:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: (The pro ain’t bigger) ‎<This message was edited>
[22/01/2026, 12:49:19] ceylan: alrighty
[22/01/2026, 12:49:21] ceylan: so
[22/01/2026, 12:49:23] ceylan: which phne
[22/01/2026, 12:49:25] ceylan: 16 or 17
[22/01/2026, 12:49:27] ceylan: normal
[22/01/2026, 12:49:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: Wdym?
[22/01/2026, 12:49:34] ceylan: is most similar whilst having good quality
[22/01/2026, 12:49:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: They are both very similar phones
[22/01/2026, 12:49:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: Actually
[22/01/2026, 12:50:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s just straight up a lie
[22/01/2026, 12:50:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s the biggest generational change of any iPhone
[22/01/2026, 12:50:17] Oscar Hunt Brown: Get the 17
[22/01/2026, 12:50:24] ceylan: what’s the differences between 16 and 17
[22/01/2026, 12:50:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s basically a reskinned 16 pro
[22/01/2026, 12:51:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: Higher refresh rate, marginally better camera, much better front camera, bigger battery, always on display
[22/01/2026, 12:51:02] ceylan: idk the features of any of them icl
[22/01/2026, 12:51:08] ceylan: hmm
[22/01/2026, 12:51:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: Those are the main ones that I remember
[22/01/2026, 12:51:12] ceylan: the always on display isn’t smth i fw
[22/01/2026, 12:51:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s a setting bro
[22/01/2026, 12:51:27] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s off by default I think
[22/01/2026, 12:52:01] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I can confirm that it is honestly on par with the 120Hz display
[22/01/2026, 12:52:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: I couldn’t get a phone without those 2 now
[22/01/2026, 12:52:19] ceylan: right right
[22/01/2026, 12:52:29] ceylan: i’ll have a gander today and i’ll lyk
[22/01/2026, 12:52:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: If the decision is between the 16 and 17, get the 17
[22/01/2026, 12:52:49] Oscar Hunt Brown: You won’t regret it
[22/01/2026, 12:53:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: The 16 is more similar to the 13 you have than it is to the 17
[22/01/2026, 12:53:19] ceylan: right
[22/01/2026, 12:53:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: Anything else you’d like to know?
[22/01/2026, 12:54:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: Also you’ll need a usb-c cable for either (you get a c to c cable with the phone)
[22/01/2026, 12:54:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: But if you don’t have a plug that takes c, you either need a new plug or cable
[22/01/2026, 12:57:18] Dakota: What’s the wireless charging like on the newer phones?
[22/01/2026, 12:58:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: Exactly the same as it is in the phones you guys have, except that if you spend £50 on apple’s magsafe charger it goes marginally faster
[22/01/2026, 12:58:27] Oscar Hunt Brown: I would highly recommend investing in a MagSafe case and charger
[22/01/2026, 12:58:36] ceylan: lowkey i’ll ask once i see
[22/01/2026, 12:58:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ok

[23/01/2026, 12:59:17] ceylan: he has a few accounts dw
[23/01/2026, 12:59:23] ceylan: think his current one is a new one cos his last got banned

[23/01/2026, 13:00:18] ceylan: i got this book right
[23/01/2026, 13:00:24] ceylan: to read as a sort of romantasy filler
[23/01/2026, 13:00:28] ceylan: knowing it’d be a bit of an easy read
[23/01/2026, 13:00:28] River: Ooh
[23/01/2026, 13:00:32] ceylan: but holy shit it’s buns
[23/01/2026, 13:00:36] ceylan: like i’ll carry on cos im hopeful
[23/01/2026, 13:00:38] ceylan: but man…
[23/01/2026, 13:00:45] River: 😔
[23/01/2026, 13:00:54] River: If it's bad then abuse the book
[23/01/2026, 13:01:01] ceylan: the plot is a sick concept but it’s just so poorly written
[23/01/2026, 13:01:04] ceylan: might have to
[23/01/2026, 13:01:14] River: Use it in cool crafts

[23/01/2026, 17:02:11] William Stothard: And 50p
[23/01/2026, 17:02:27] William Stothard: That's becoming a daily snack
[23/01/2026, 17:02:35] Dakota: That is cheap tbf
[23/01/2026, 17:02:36] ceylan: exactly my thoughts
[23/01/2026, 17:02:47] ceylan: the beginning of my week was consumed by a 250k word fanfic
[23/01/2026, 17:02:51] ceylan: read it in 2 days
[23/01/2026, 17:03:03] ceylan: guys this book is NOT getting better
[23/01/2026, 17:03:12] ceylan: but i just paid a fucking tenna for it😭😭
[23/01/2026, 17:03:21] William Stothard: Dont keep reading it?
[23/01/2026, 17:03:43] Dakota: Keep it as a Christmas/birthday gift?
[23/01/2026, 17:03:49] ceylan: it’s lowkey a fraction of the size of fanfics i’ve read though
[23/01/2026, 17:03:50] William Stothard: Sounds like youll just get more upset the further you go into it
[23/01/2026, 17:03:55] ceylan: maybe i just touch it out
[23/01/2026, 17:03:57] ceylan: yeah true
[23/01/2026, 17:04:08] ceylan: the cover is so pretty so atleast it’s not a total waste
[23/01/2026, 17:04:17] ceylan: tough*??
[23/01/2026, 17:04:28] William Stothard: Rip it off, frame it, bin the book
[23/01/2026, 17:05:09] ceylan: u might be onto something
[23/01/2026, 17:05:53] William Stothard: My wisdom knows no bounds
[23/01/2026, 17:06:11] William Stothard: Anyhow imma touch a book of literal all evil
[23/01/2026, 17:06:56] Dakota: I don’t think Ben was actually prepared for you to succeed on the roll to detect it
[23/01/2026, 17:16:09] William Stothard: Uh no he knew I would
[23/01/2026, 17:16:29] William Stothard: Bro knew full well I would succeed

[24/01/2026, 08:46:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m gonna go have breakfast in a min
[24/01/2026, 08:46:40] River: I'm meant to be going to an open day to the college I'm hoping to move to and mums ill so I can't go😔
[24/01/2026, 08:46:53] Oscar Hunt Brown: Oh
[24/01/2026, 08:46:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s unfortunate

‎[25/01/2026, 12:07:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: I made a pointless 3:3 line adapter for my pointless giga generator that I can’t afford to run ‎image omitted
[25/01/2026, 12:07:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: I can’t show you the generator cuz it’s too big to fit on the screen and most of it is empty space because of all the splitters
[25/01/2026, 12:08:43] Dakota: Surely there’s an easier way, like a 1:1
[25/01/2026, 12:09:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yep
[25/01/2026, 12:09:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: I could’ve done that
[25/01/2026, 12:09:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: I need 3 lines and I’m giving it 3
[25/01/2026, 12:09:57] Dakota: It’s cool, but only useful if one source dries up really
[25/01/2026, 12:10:03] Oscar Hunt Brown: But instead of just doing that, I’m splitting each line 3 ways and then merging those thirds
[25/01/2026, 12:10:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s the neat part
[25/01/2026, 12:10:16] Oscar Hunt Brown: They all pull from the same source
[25/01/2026, 12:10:23] Oscar Hunt Brown: So they’re all on or they’re all off
[25/01/2026, 12:10:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: Also this uses like 5 times as many batteries as I make
‎[25/01/2026, 12:10:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: ‎image omitted
[25/01/2026, 12:11:01] Dakota: Now make one that does 4:3
[25/01/2026, 12:11:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ok
[25/01/2026, 12:11:33] Oscar Hunt Brown: So
[25/01/2026, 12:11:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s completely pointless
[25/01/2026, 12:11:51] Dakota: Yep
[25/01/2026, 12:11:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: I did 3 because 2 couldn’t provide enough batteries
[25/01/2026, 12:12:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: Each line gives me 30/min
[25/01/2026, 12:12:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: And I need (funnily enough) 67/min
‎[25/01/2026, 12:12:33] ceylan: ‎GIF omitted
[25/01/2026, 12:12:44] Oscar Hunt Brown: Which is more than the 60/min of 2 lines and less than 90/min from 3 lines
[25/01/2026, 12:12:46] Dakota: Silence
[25/01/2026, 12:12:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: Stfu bitch
[25/01/2026, 12:12:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: Anyway
[25/01/2026, 12:13:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: 4 would literally do nothing
[25/01/2026, 12:13:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: And also I can’t actually get 4 where I’m doing this
[25/01/2026, 12:13:45] Dakota: So it sounds to me like you now need to go 6:6
[25/01/2026, 12:14:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: **sigh**
[25/01/2026, 12:14:17] Oscar Hunt Brown: It took long enough to do this with access to blueprints
[25/01/2026, 12:14:26] Dakota: And so the factory expands
[25/01/2026, 12:14:30] Oscar Hunt Brown: To do that, it’s bigger than the space I can place blueprints
[25/01/2026, 12:14:41] Oscar Hunt Brown: So I’d have place the majority of things by hand
[25/01/2026, 12:14:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: And also that’s about twice this size
[25/01/2026, 12:15:03] Oscar Hunt Brown: So I’d need the same amount of space as 4 of these
[25/01/2026, 12:15:12] Oscar Hunt Brown: So it’s also much less efficient
[25/01/2026, 12:15:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: But needs less lines than 4 of these
[25/01/2026, 12:15:52] Dakota: Ok hear me out, verticality
[25/01/2026, 12:16:09] Oscar Hunt Brown: Unfortunately not a thing in arknights

[26/01/2026, 13:45:02] River: Not even just "haunted" THE OWNER SOLD HIS SOUL TO THE DEVIL FOR GOLD

[27/01/2026, 15:24:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: https://youtu.be/z2q23CtnqUA?si=BjfK7Qu2MUkfKes4 new warbond
[27/01/2026, 15:24:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: And it looks fun
[27/01/2026, 15:24:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: Lots of explosives
[27/01/2026, 15:24:20] Oscar Hunt Brown: And laser shotgun
[27/01/2026, 15:24:25] Oscar Hunt Brown: And shield grenade
[27/01/2026, 15:24:47] Dakota: And a belt fed grenade launcher
[27/01/2026, 15:24:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: Comes under explosives
[27/01/2026, 15:25:01] Oscar Hunt Brown: But in that case
[27/01/2026, 15:25:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: Boom hammer
[27/01/2026, 15:25:17] Oscar Hunt Brown: And hellbomb launcher too
[27/01/2026, 15:25:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: I want to know what the armour passive is
[27/01/2026, 15:25:45] Dakota: Does the hammer boom?
[27/01/2026, 15:25:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yes
[27/01/2026, 15:25:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: It explodes
[27/01/2026, 15:26:06] Oscar Hunt Brown: With enough force to one hit hulks
[27/01/2026, 15:26:14] Dakota: Holy shit
[27/01/2026, 15:26:21] Oscar Hunt Brown: It also must be reloaded
[27/01/2026, 15:26:26] Oscar Hunt Brown: Which I think is fun
[27/01/2026, 15:26:33] Oscar Hunt Brown: You need to replace the head each time
[27/01/2026, 15:26:35] Dakota: A small price to pay
[27/01/2026, 15:26:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: Indeed
[27/01/2026, 15:26:51] Dakota: I wonder how many heads we can carry
[27/01/2026, 15:27:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: I wonder if arrowhead will allow it to count as melee damage? ‎<This message was edited>
[27/01/2026, 15:27:15] Dakota: Probably
[27/01/2026, 15:27:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: One can hope
[27/01/2026, 15:28:23] Dakota: The passive will probably be something for better explosions or  explosions resistance, in th style of inflammable
[27/01/2026, 15:28:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: Or
[27/01/2026, 15:28:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: Extra munitions for explosive weaponry
[27/01/2026, 15:28:58] Dakota: True
[27/01/2026, 15:29:24] Dakota: Might be for the hammer specifically, named head hunter
[27/01/2026, 15:29:40] Oscar Hunt Brown: I doubt that
[27/01/2026, 15:29:58] Oscar Hunt Brown: They wouldn’t make an armour set for a melee weapon
[27/01/2026, 15:30:09] Dakota: Good point
[27/01/2026, 15:30:50] Dakota: Ooh what about an ammo catcher type thing that gives a chance to use explosives/explosive ammo without expending them
[27/01/2026, 15:31:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t think they’d do that
[27/01/2026, 15:31:08] Oscar Hunt Brown: That seems very difficult to do
[27/01/2026, 15:31:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: And have be semi realistic at the same time
[27/01/2026, 15:31:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: If it explodes, that’s it, it went boom
[27/01/2026, 15:31:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: You can’t get the ammo back
[27/01/2026, 15:31:47] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz it exploded
[27/01/2026, 15:32:16] Dakota: Ik your right, but one can hope
[27/01/2026, 16:16:00] Dakota: I found the passive
[27/01/2026, 16:16:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: What is it?
[27/01/2026, 16:16:23] Dakota: Called supplementary adrenaline, taking damage restores stamina
[27/01/2026, 16:16:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: Not bad
[27/01/2026, 16:16:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: I fuck with it
[27/01/2026, 16:17:00] Dakota: Definitely good for running on high diff bot missions
[27/01/2026, 16:17:16] Dakota: I think imma stick with siege ready for the siege breakers
[27/01/2026, 16:17:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: Same probably
[27/01/2026, 16:17:38] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ll probably try it though
[27/01/2026, 16:17:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: Seems like my thing
[27/01/2026, 16:17:47] Dakota: And the shield nade is just a throwable bubble
[27/01/2026, 16:17:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: But imma need the light version
[27/01/2026, 16:17:57] Oscar Hunt Brown: Which is not in the warbond
[27/01/2026, 16:18:01] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yup
[27/01/2026, 16:18:05] Oscar Hunt Brown: Can’t wait
[27/01/2026, 16:18:22] Dakota: Which means you can be triple bubbled alone
[27/01/2026, 16:18:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
‎[27/01/2026, 16:38:53] William Stothard: Glorious evening ‎image omitted

[28/01/2026, 07:33:18] Dakota: Fun, but unrewarding alone
[28/01/2026, 07:33:59] River: True
[28/01/2026, 07:40:04] ceylan: found one in snibston once
[28/01/2026, 08:31:01] Fin: Hey guys, I won’t be able to talk for a bit because Tom banned me again, I’ll let you know when I get unbanned again.

[28/01/2026, 08:56:01] William Stothard: Best of luck mate!
[28/01/2026, 09:31:50] River: Does anyone else get a feel of ruin in your stomach and constant thoughts of death
[28/01/2026, 09:32:12] ceylan: occasionally baddie but stay safe love you
[28/01/2026, 09:32:31] River: Idk how to make it stop tho
[28/01/2026, 09:32:38] River: It's been like 3 straight days
[28/01/2026, 09:32:46] James: Tad random
[28/01/2026, 09:32:52] James: So lil confused
[28/01/2026, 09:32:56] James: You good dude?
[28/01/2026, 09:33:01] River: Yeah I'm good
[28/01/2026, 09:33:48] ceylan: If you wanted to rant to me ever queen feel free but I can’t give any comprehensive responses rn cos of class but my dms are always open
[28/01/2026, 09:33:55] Dakota: I find eating and sitting outside admiring beauty, not thinking about much kinda helps just taking a break from stress
[28/01/2026, 09:34:27] River: Yeah but I can't just not think of anything, I'm always thinking of something
[28/01/2026, 09:35:04] River: And unfortunately the past few days my brain has decided that it's gonna be the fear of dying and becoming nothing once again and having to start over
[28/01/2026, 09:37:32] Oscar Hunt Brown: I find that music helps with not thinking
[28/01/2026, 09:37:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: If you want some recommendations, I can give some
[28/01/2026, 09:38:06] River: Yes please 🙏
[28/01/2026, 09:38:27] Oscar Hunt Brown: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6yk9c5eD4FzF17r2IYajSg?si=-GETZ2W-TYOT_OSlM-o9cA&pi=ZpvTv7PtT9GhW
[28/01/2026, 09:39:34] Dakota: Will is a great guy to talk to for putting a positive spin on that, but I’ll try my best. Becoming nothing and starting anew is part of the great beauty of the endless universe, you get to become anything and everything, you can become someone totally different and no one will hold anything against you for it. Think about the rolling hills and the trees, the animals that roam them. The trees that saw the dinosaurs power our cars now and we thank them for it. When we are gone we will help the planet by giving our bodies to the earth. The stars care not for your actions, and that in itself is beautiful.
[28/01/2026, 09:40:41] Oscar Hunt Brown: Such is life
[28/01/2026, 09:42:51] Dakota: Such is life

[28/01/2026, 21:39:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m trapped in a mental limbo rn
[28/01/2026, 21:40:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: I want to go to bed, but don’t want to go into my room
[28/01/2026, 21:40:11] ceylan: why
[28/01/2026, 21:40:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: Hard to put it
[28/01/2026, 21:40:33] Dakota: Do you want solutions to the room or to sleeping arrangements?
[28/01/2026, 21:42:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I’ve basically just lay there pointlessly for hours over the last few days and I felt like shit and I went out last night to see the stars and spoke to Fin and it was epic and today I did awesome shit like actually working on my NEA and did all of my homework and my room just feels like a pit of hopelessness and despair almost rn
[28/01/2026, 21:43:21] Dakota: Easy temporary solution or harder long term solution?
[28/01/2026, 21:43:39] Oscar Hunt Brown: Give me both, as usual I’ll probably be over it by tomorrow
[28/01/2026, 21:44:49] Dakota: Easy solution, find somewhere else to sleep for the night (sofa etc)
Hard solution, music on, carb snack, maybe energy drink/caffine and clean the room
[28/01/2026, 21:45:20] ceylan: i know it’s lowkey crazy but a good wank puts me right to sleep
[28/01/2026, 21:45:29] ceylan: put some white noise on and boom
[28/01/2026, 21:45:32] ceylan: asleep like a baby
[28/01/2026, 21:45:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s not about sleep
[28/01/2026, 21:45:42] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s that I don’t want to be in my room rn
[28/01/2026, 21:45:48] ceylan: ah right
[28/01/2026, 21:45:58] ceylan: yeah maybe just hijack the sofa tonight and see how you feel tomorrow

[28/01/2026, 21:46:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m on the sofa rn
[28/01/2026, 21:46:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I may clean my room
[28/01/2026, 21:47:07] Dakota: Unfortunately the effects of finishing on a man compared to a woman are almost completely opposite, males tend to feel more energised and active afterwards bc huntergather hormones to prevent starving by fetching food
[28/01/2026, 21:47:22] ceylan: damn

[29/01/2026, 13:59:41] River: I don't agree with them as they hold a standard that isn't realistic and also show toxic relationships between family and friends as 'normal'
[29/01/2026, 14:00:57] William Stothard: To what extent do you believe they rely on the clothes they wear and the figure of the person wearing them?
[29/01/2026, 14:01:04] William Stothard: (another question from debate)
[29/01/2026, 14:02:53] River: They believe that the clothes they wear hold power to getting what they want and need, this is extremely unhealthy and proposes a way of life that isn't realistic
[29/01/2026, 14:02:59] River: Idk bro I'm multitasking rn
[29/01/2026, 14:03:49] William Stothard: Its all good i am just curious
[29/01/2026, 14:07:16] Stan: The fact that certain pageants have become embedded within the cultures of families leading to a culture of what i can only call abuse is disgraceful
[29/01/2026, 14:07:57] Stan: Not to mention the impossibly high standards which can be placed on children as young as 5
[29/01/2026, 14:08:39] Stan: Also other news

[30/01/2026, 16:34:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m trying to work out how to use vectors to create a line of motion
[30/01/2026, 16:35:01] Oscar Hunt Brown: To get a circle to move from a to b
[30/01/2026, 16:35:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: (a is the top left corner and b is the bottom right)

[30/01/2026, 16:38:11] Oscar Hunt Brown: Literally all im trying to do
[30/01/2026, 16:38:27] William Stothard: Yes
[30/01/2026, 16:38:33] William Stothard: I am returning soon
[30/01/2026, 16:38:34] Oscar Hunt Brown: But p5 uses their own data type for vectors so I can’t use normal mathematical operations for it
[30/01/2026, 16:38:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: I have to use p5’s built in functions
[30/01/2026, 16:38:48] Oscar Hunt Brown: And they aren’t as nice
[30/01/2026, 16:40:44] Oscar Hunt Brown: OK there are some really cool functions for vectors
[30/01/2026, 16:40:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: That are incredibly useful
‎[30/01/2026, 17:00:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: The Python-rot is crazy ‎image omitted
[30/01/2026, 17:01:03] Oscar Hunt Brown: I can’t stop typing print when I want to output a value
[30/01/2026, 17:01:25] Oscar Hunt Brown: So instead of fixing it, I made a function called print that outputs the value I enter
[30/01/2026, 17:01:59] Dakota: In the nicest way possible, nerd
[30/01/2026, 17:02:25] Oscar Hunt Brown: Ok?
[30/01/2026, 17:02:47] Dakota: Well done, you were stubborn enough that you made life easier
[30/01/2026, 17:02:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: I managed to get the vector stuff working btw
[30/01/2026, 17:03:07] Oscar Hunt Brown: So I’m trying to get it to bounce off the borders now
[30/01/2026, 17:03:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s not working :(
[30/01/2026, 17:03:14] Dakota: But you will have to port that into every script you write in future
[30/01/2026, 17:03:22] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yep
[30/01/2026, 17:03:33] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ll just rewrite it, it’s not too hard
[30/01/2026, 17:03:46] Dakota: Give it bounds and generate a random angle within those bounds to redirect?
[30/01/2026, 17:04:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: I figured out why it wasn’t working
[30/01/2026, 17:04:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: Print already exists
[30/01/2026, 17:04:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: And js doesn’t like me overwriting its functions
[30/01/2026, 17:05:24] Dakota: Will it let you if you try hard enough?
[30/01/2026, 17:05:31] Oscar Hunt Brown: No
[30/01/2026, 17:05:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: I just renamed it
[30/01/2026, 17:05:47] Dakota: Oh
[30/01/2026, 17:06:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: I worked out why I was getting an error
[30/01/2026, 17:07:14] Oscar Hunt Brown: I was using a vector function on a single part of the vector
[30/01/2026, 17:07:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: Since it’s just a number, I can use normal operators
[30/01/2026, 17:07:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: And vector functions won’t work
[30/01/2026, 17:07:50] Oscar Hunt Brown: Because (funnily enough) it’s not a vector
[30/01/2026, 17:08:23] Dakota: Ah
[30/01/2026, 17:09:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: It’s still dying
[30/01/2026, 17:09:47] Dakota: Uh oh
[30/01/2026, 17:10:15] Oscar Hunt Brown: I know why it’s getting stuck
[30/01/2026, 17:10:24] Oscar Hunt Brown: Basically
[30/01/2026, 17:10:43] Oscar Hunt Brown: It will always go through (0,0) cuz it a direct line
[30/01/2026, 17:10:56] Oscar Hunt Brown: And all of my conditions are then true at (0,0)
[30/01/2026, 17:11:05] Oscar Hunt Brown: So it doesn’t know what to do and gets stuck
[30/01/2026, 17:11:30] Dakota: Oh cool so a simple offset should fix it
[30/01/2026, 17:11:55] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t intend to offset it
[30/01/2026, 17:12:02] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’ll work something out when I get back

[30/01/2026, 20:44:03] ceylan: nah but sometimes you can only think of things you disagree with

[31/01/2026, 00:14:16] Dakota: Any luck yet?
[31/01/2026, 00:14:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: He decided to sleep before I could fix it
[31/01/2026, 00:14:51] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m waiting for training to finish for my gpt
[31/01/2026, 00:15:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’m trying a different data set
[31/01/2026, 00:15:10] Oscar Hunt Brown: But I’ll probably train it on a few
[31/01/2026, 00:15:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: Cuz they’re different styles
[31/01/2026, 00:15:37] Oscar Hunt Brown: And the language used in this one doesn’t seem like it works great for this
[31/01/2026, 00:16:26] Dakota: Could you export this chat and upload it to learn from? Giving it a variety of linguistic styles to read and understand
[31/01/2026, 00:16:39] Oscar Hunt Brown: That’s a fucking amazing idea
[31/01/2026, 00:16:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: I don’t think I can
[31/01/2026, 00:16:59] Dakota: Not sure how it’d cope with the pictures and gifs
[31/01/2026, 00:17:06] Oscar Hunt Brown: Because WhatsApp’s encryption is lowkey crazy, but I will investigate
[31/01/2026, 00:17:18] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’d have to filter through it for those
[31/01/2026, 00:17:48] Dakota: There’s a button to export chat which downloads it as a text pdf I think, with option to include images or not
[31/01/2026, 00:17:54] Oscar Hunt Brown: There’s a setting turned on in here that prevents it
[31/01/2026, 00:18:00] Oscar Hunt Brown: Just tried exporting it
[31/01/2026, 00:18:14] Dakota: Ah advanced chat privacy
[31/01/2026, 00:18:19] Oscar Hunt Brown: Yeah
[31/01/2026, 00:18:35] Stan: Don’t forget all the absolutely devious shit we’ve said
[31/01/2026, 00:18:43] Stan: Your ai could probably go without it
[31/01/2026, 00:18:55] Oscar Hunt Brown: Varied dataset dude
[31/01/2026, 00:19:04] Oscar Hunt Brown: I wouldn’t train it off of purely this
[31/01/2026, 00:19:13] Oscar Hunt Brown: It wouldn’t get much useful info from it
[31/01/2026, 00:19:25] Oscar Hunt Brown: I’d use some of the other text files I have with it
