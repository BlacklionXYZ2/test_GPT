[22/01/2025, 16:52:05] Jamie: Ohh
[22/01/2025, 16:52:16] Ava: A snake slithers into a bar. The bartender says, “I’m sorry, but I can’t serve you.” The snake asks, “Why not?” The bartender answers, “Because you can’t hold your liquor.”

[23/01/2025, 07:52:10] Ava: Summon Toe
[23/01/2025, 07:52:16] Jamie: NO.
[23/01/2025, 07:52:26] Jamie: I do not want to see that man
[23/01/2025, 07:52:30] Ava: Summon an exam demon

[23/01/2025, 08:04:49] Jack Payne: That summons spirit or soul based entities. Demons don’t count as that
It’s why you need a sacrifice for demons but not spirits

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb Climb Climb Climb
He has something to prove he has nothing to lose
Lose Lose Lose Lose
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time Time Time Time
What is it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesn't hesitate.
He exhibits no restraint.
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway.
He changes the game.
He plays and he raises the stakes.
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive
Then Goddamnit I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it...
I'm willing to wait for it...
Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes.
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
We fall and we make our mistakes.
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to- then I'm willin' to-
Wait for it... Wait for it... Wait for it...
Wait for it... Wait for it... Wait for it...
Wait for it... Wait for it... Wait for it...
Wait for it... Wait for it... Wait...

[30/01/2025, 16:54:46] Jamie: Ok so in history it was noted that a vampire’s bite felt sensual, as vampires were fairly romanticised 🩷
[30/01/2025, 16:54:49] Jamie: Maybe
[30/01/2025, 16:55:11] Willis Toyer: The answer needs to be yes
[30/01/2025, 16:55:16] Ava: That's awesome. Do you believe in them?
[30/01/2025, 16:55:29] Jamie: I have the choice to say no
[30/01/2025, 16:55:43] Jamie: That vampires exist? Nah but it’d be cool if they did
[30/01/2025, 16:55:51] Willis Toyer: The only answer is yes
[30/01/2025, 16:55:57] Jamie: Is it thoo
[30/01/2025, 16:56:05] Ava: I think that the stories had to come from somewhere. So I think there's some form of them
[30/01/2025, 16:56:06] Willis Toyer: Yes it is thooooo
[30/01/2025, 16:56:36] Jamie: Yeah I suppose so, but honestly I heard that the bites weren’t as painful as people make it out to be
[30/01/2025, 16:56:45] Jamie: It’s meant to arouse the victim n shit
[30/01/2025, 16:56:48] Ava: Not like Twilight
[30/01/2025, 16:57:03] Ava: Vampires are also really beautiful to attract their victims

[30/01/2025, 16:57:24] Ava: Especially if it's Michael Emerson from The Lost Boys
[30/01/2025, 16:57:40] Esme: YES
[30/01/2025, 16:57:42] Jamie: That’s like in Japanese mythology I believe that female demons are always beautiful because they’d be alluring to their victims
[30/01/2025, 16:57:53] Ava: Like sirens too
[30/01/2025, 16:57:53] Jamie: Male demons are kinda… eh

[09/02/2025, 20:33:51] River: YOU MADE THE FIRST EVENT
[09/02/2025, 20:33:57] Stan: But you had no need to attend
[09/02/2025, 20:34:00] Ava: WHY WAS I INVOLVED?
[09/02/2025, 20:34:02] Stan: That was by choice
[09/02/2025, 20:34:11] River: You said you were in me
[09/02/2025, 20:34:24] River: He told me to get an exorcism and I said you're in me

[09/02/2025, 20:37:51] Ava: As a lawyer, I encourage blackmail
[09/02/2025, 20:38:06] Stan: A crime punishable by life in prison?
[09/02/2025, 20:38:09] River: Good
[09/02/2025, 20:38:13] River: Indeed.

[09/02/2025, 20:38:26] Ava: Use the text against him
[09/02/2025, 20:38:28] Stan: By stating this you are making yourself an accomplice in this crime

[02/03/2025, 20:18:18] Esme: Ladies and germs…
I present to you:

*The hairbrush incident*
Picture this…
I’m laying in my bed, as any adolescent does on a Sunday night, watching a tv show while contemplating my existence as the crushing realisation that I have school in the morning bears down on my tired shoulders.

Subconsciously, I reach over to my bedside table and grab hold of a rounded hairbrush. I start to brush through my luscious locks, feeling the silky smooth strands of hair as they run through the plastic bristles. All of a sudden, it was like a lightbulb went off above my head. It’s light so strong and appealing that I could not ignore the illumination and its call. 

I brush a large strand of hair, at the very front of my head, down to the ends. Promptly, I roll it up to my head as one would do with hair rollers. 
‘This is fine.’ I think, under the foolish assumption that I would simply be able to roll the brush back the way it came. 

My fingers grasp the handle of the brush with perseverance and prepare to smoothly remove the brush from my hair. I pull and…

*juck* … *juck*

My hair is stuck in the fucking brush. 
THE BRUSH IS STUCK TO MY HEAD 

I rush to the bathroom and desperately try to pull it out; the however; the brush holds no mercy and my pleas remain unheard. After roughly ten minutes of this pain and suffering I stick my head under the bath tap and cover my head in conditioner, thinking this would aid to relieve the tension and tangles on my head. 
It did not. 

Eventually, I had to call my dearest mother upstairs, who found me half-dressed, dripping wet, covered in slimy conditioner with a brush stuck to the top of my head. 
Through a lot of pain, torture, laughing and a few ‘Esme, what have you done?’s…the brush is out. The knot that had accumulated on my head is detangled. 
I am free.
[02/03/2025, 20:19:20] Ava: That is absolutely amazing
[02/03/2025, 20:19:30] River: Poetry, brought a tear to my eye
[02/03/2025, 20:19:30] Ava: I am so sorry for your trauma
[02/03/2025, 20:19:35] Ava: I shed a tear
[02/03/2025, 20:19:41] Esme: Thank you 🙏 
Prayers are appreciated
[02/03/2025, 20:23:24] Willis Toyer: Damn
[03/03/2025, 03:12:47] River: The girl my ex cheated on me with posted a rant about how she hates cheaters and if she knew any she would beat them up, she was very clear that it's the other girls fault too and they're just desperate, who gon tell her she was the other girl this time last year 🙏🏻🙏🏻

[03/03/2025, 21:39:06] Ava: Nothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost
[03/03/2025, 21:39:40] Esme: Also anything from Ariel by Sylvia Plath
[03/03/2025, 21:39:54] Ava: Closely followed by The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost
[03/03/2025, 21:40:08] Stan: I love ‘stand at my grave and weep’ which is attributed to Mary Elizabeth Frye
[03/03/2025, 21:40:09] Esme: Not poetry but ‘places I’ve taken my body: essays’
[03/03/2025, 21:40:15] Stan: Fairs
[03/03/2025, 21:40:27] Ava: Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.
[03/03/2025, 21:40:40] Ava: Best poem cause it's in The Outsiders
[03/03/2025, 21:40:46] Ava: Stay gold, Ponyboy
[03/03/2025, 21:41:39] Stan: Do not stand
          By my grave, and weep.
     I am not there,
          I do not sleep—
I am the thousand winds that blow
I am the diamond glints in snow
I am the sunlight on ripened grain,
I am the gentle, autumn rain.
As you awake with morning’s hush,
I am the swift, up-flinging rush
Of quiet birds in circling flight,
I am the day transcending night.
     Do not stand
          By my grave, and cry—
     I am not there,
          I did not die.
[03/03/2025, 21:41:48] Stan: I love it cus its hopeful
[03/03/2025, 21:42:07] Ava: I actually love that. That's beautiful

[08/03/2025, 21:37:32] Ava: Fucking hell- you weren't joking in PE

[14/03/2025, 17:24:48] Esme: I don’t read dead dove do not eat fics
[14/03/2025, 17:24:53] Esme: They traumatise me

[14/03/2025, 17:26:13] Jamie: Like tf you mean you locked me up because you love me so much..?
[14/03/2025, 17:26:17] Jamie: TOXIC MUCH
[14/03/2025, 17:26:18] Jack Payne: I can usually handle them 
Except for this one I read that had a whole arc that had; kidnapping, NC, memory/world view manipulation. 
I don’t remember what else since I skipped that entire arc
[14/03/2025, 17:26:29] River: Oo fanfics

[14/03/2025, 17:27:11] Esme: I read one that can only be described in a single word 
Tentacles.
[14/03/2025, 17:27:20] Jamie: NO.
[14/03/2025, 17:27:22] Esme: Nothing more to say
[14/03/2025, 17:27:24] Jamie: NO.

[14/03/2025, 17:27:31] Jamie: NO TENTACLES
[14/03/2025, 17:27:45] Jack Payne: Dead Dove do not eat
Its used on fics in place of a list of warning like one of Delilah’s books has
[14/03/2025, 17:28:03] Esme: Not the trigger warning list 😭
[14/03/2025, 17:28:12] River: WOAH

Dead dove is WORSE than fifty shades of gray
[14/03/2025, 17:29:25] Jamie: “Back in my day” said by the youngest in tbe group 😭
[14/03/2025, 17:29:34] River: And what.
[14/03/2025, 17:29:35] Jack Payne: The issue is dead dove is a spectrum of bad and you can find a few wholesome dead doves since it technically could be done by a non mc or villain so remains wholesome
[14/03/2025, 17:29:48] Jamie: Nothing :3
[14/03/2025, 17:30:03] Stan: Jack you’re trying to explain away kidnapping

And actually controlled by my iPad since I’m reading
[13/04/2025, 21:55:14] Jack Payne: On a scale of 1 to yes 
How much of a twink does unironically listening to little mix and having several peices of their merch make me

Then, me and Jamie were in school but it was this weird series of tunnels belonging to a fat creepy guy who I think was trying to kidnap us. Then we escaped but while I was at home (alone) I kept hearing the fat creepy guy ring doorbell and jiggle the handle. But for some reason, I just ignored it and put my headphones on?? (brianstorm by arctic monkeys btw) like girl call the police!!!

[18/04/2025, 18:07:39] Jack Payne: Plus there’s no new speakers in the background noise which usually happens with supposedly haunted places
[18/04/2025, 21:51:57] Esme: Spooky
[18/04/2025, 21:52:01] Esme: Don’t get murdered
[18/04/2025, 21:52:03] Ava: That's awful

[18/04/2025, 22:41:52] Jamie: Ah fair enough
[18/04/2025, 22:42:07] Jack Payne: Though I do see a couple small glowing dots near the lamppost but that could just be lights from a town in the distance

[28/05/2025, 21:10:46] Delilah Mee: Okay okay
[28/05/2025, 21:11:06] Delilah Mee: I might just buy a big one to start with so I don't have to keep changing it
[28/05/2025, 21:11:25] River: I recommend slitherin reptiles for that tho because they have a starter kit with everything included
[28/05/2025, 21:11:34] River: Which will last them up to a couple years
[28/05/2025, 21:12:21] River: Getting a bigger one could be good but it could also lead to stress but tbf it depends on the snake and also its normal to not see them for a day or so because they're exploring their new home fr
[28/05/2025, 21:12:31] Delilah Mee: Okay
[28/05/2025, 21:13:13] River: Vivs can be expensive but if I can find any good ones second hand would you like me to shoot you a message?

[06/06/2025, 19:30:06] Jamie: OH!
[06/06/2025, 19:30:41] Esme: That’s acc really sad
[06/06/2025, 19:30:52] Esme: Poor liz 😔
[06/06/2025, 19:31:21] Jamie: Real question why was she and the kids kicked
[06/06/2025, 19:31:36] Jamie: Surely the person who looks after the kids keeps the house?
[06/06/2025, 19:32:15] Esme: I feel like that’s common sense
[06/06/2025, 19:32:54] Jamie: It should be common sense
[06/06/2025, 19:33:04] Jamie: That’s how my parents did it 🤷‍♀️
[06/06/2025, 19:33:11] Stan: Technically whoever owns the house (signed for it) keeps the house
[06/06/2025, 19:33:17] Esme: Yeah same
[06/06/2025, 19:33:19] Stan: Unless some other legal settlement is found
[06/06/2025, 19:33:36] Jamie: Even so you wouldn’t kick the kids out too
[06/06/2025, 19:33:43] Jamie: That’s illogical
[06/06/2025, 19:33:53] Stan: Some dudes just don’t want em
[06/06/2025, 19:34:04] Stan: Its fucked up but its true

[06/06/2025, 19:36:34] Jamie: Honestly same like I dislike her as a teacher but being kicked out isn’t fun
[06/06/2025, 19:36:37] Stan: FR queen
[06/06/2025, 19:37:06] Jamie: In my opinion men should still own up even if they don’t want em tbh
[06/06/2025, 19:37:32] Jamie: UNLESS the woman made it so she’d get pregnant without him knowing
[06/06/2025, 19:37:37] Jamie: That’s a different situation
[06/06/2025, 19:37:41] Stan: Even so
[06/06/2025, 19:37:47] Stan: She coulda got rid of em if she wanted
[06/06/2025, 19:37:51] Stan: Thats her right

[06/06/2025, 19:38:23] Stan: Stay protected folks

Twice
Consecutively

[31/07/2025, 21:04:42] Jack Payne: Well
It’s not my fault that oxygen/air deprivation doesn’t stop me laughing
[31/07/2025, 21:05:01] Jack Payne: It has on occasion made me laugh harder as well
[31/07/2025, 21:05:01] Jamie: Oh how lovely to hear that
[31/07/2025, 21:05:22] Esme: …are you a masochist

[31/07/2025, 21:05:52] Ava: So the lion fell in love with the lamb
[31/07/2025, 21:06:14] Jack Payne: Is that a reference to something

[31/07/2025, 21:06:47] Jack Payne: How is the lion a masochist in that situation though
[31/07/2025, 21:06:50] Ava: What a stupid lamb

[31/07/2025, 21:07:09] Esme: Cause he’s a vampire and is hurting himself by being with the girl he also wants to eat
[31/07/2025, 21:07:15] Ava: Exactly
[31/07/2025, 21:07:54] Jack Payne: Vampires could entirely be a real thing
They may just live at the bottom of the ocean

[28/08/2025, 10:18:10] Jack Payne: Not to the extent it happens for him. By which I mean every five minutes.

It is just more evidence towards mine and Stan’s belief that he may become a wifebeater

[28/08/2025, 10:22:57] Jamie: Yeah nah 100% wife beater material

‘You just need to learn to work with how your brain works’
This from the woman who refuses to let me get tested
[12/09/2025, 08:32:31] Jamie: Oh.
[12/09/2025, 08:32:37] Jamie: How ironic
[12/09/2025, 08:34:17] Jack Payne: She also said her brain works the same way mine does so 
Here’s the facts of the situation 
My brother — diagnosed autistic
My dad — acts the same as my brother
My mom — brain wired for straight flows of thought and can completely thoughts simply by thinking ahead or getting interrupted
Me — the same as my mom

[12/09/2025, 08:38:31] Jack Payne: That’s what I’m saying 
But they won’t let me get tested
