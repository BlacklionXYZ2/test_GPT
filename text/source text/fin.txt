[02/06/2025, 07:51:01] Oscar Hunt Brown: This is just to make sure everything is communicated for the 20th of June
[02/06/2025, 07:51:15] River: 😨
[02/06/2025, 07:51:16] James: Wait what's happening then
[02/06/2025, 07:51:29] Oscar Hunt Brown: Everyone’s coming round mine and camping out

And what for
[02/06/2025, 07:51:39] Oscar Hunt Brown: TBD
[02/06/2025, 07:52:18] River: Kfc
[02/06/2025, 07:52:18] James: Ok I'll need the address though

[02/06/2025, 07:52:35] James: Cheers
[02/06/2025, 07:54:20] Jamie: Wait whatt
[02/06/2025, 07:54:35] Oscar Hunt Brown: I thought we talked about doing this at school
[02/06/2025, 07:54:45] Oscar Hunt Brown: Since it’s the last time we’ll see fin
[02/06/2025, 07:54:47] Jamie: I thought we were joking around🥀
[02/06/2025, 07:54:52] Oscar Hunt Brown: Nope
[02/06/2025, 07:55:02] Jamie: I’ll see if I could make it
[02/06/2025, 07:55:06] Jack Payne: I need more clarification 
Are we sacrificing fin in exchange for kfc
Or are we sacrificing him to colonel sanders
[02/06/2025, 07:55:15] Jamie: Both
[02/06/2025, 07:55:25] Jack Payne: Noted

[02/06/2025, 08:00:22] Jack Payne: We might have an issue for summoning/linking the sacrifice 
We likely need the seasoning mix that kfc uses 
But that shit is lock and key to krabby patty formula proportions
[02/06/2025, 08:00:39] River: Oh dw I got a guy
[02/06/2025, 08:00:47] Ava: I'll just become plankton and steal it
[02/06/2025, 08:05:27] William Stothard: Nah its simple and easy, you just flay him and draw blood, and then eat him in the ensuing feast
[02/06/2025, 08:05:35] William Stothard: Trust 🙏
[02/06/2025, 08:05:56] River: Wills done this before chat, trust him 🙏🏻
[02/06/2025, 08:06:20] William Stothard: Ong
[02/06/2025, 08:06:39] Jack Payne: That’s how you sacrifice
But if you don’t link it 
Then it’s essential a free buffet for any nearby spirits or other similar beings
[02/06/2025, 08:06:40] River: Fin will be fine,  we're just preparing him for Australia
[02/06/2025, 08:06:56] William Stothard: Simple, words
[02/06/2025, 08:08:10] William Stothard: Just say, here me o great colonel sanders, master of fried foodstuffs, slayer of avians, accept this offering of a virgin deep fried in your honour
